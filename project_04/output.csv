I can't deny reality as life gets smothered

If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
Cause he who paints the big picture runs the whole scene

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous? Am I better off dead?

Punishment, for all my sins

A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind

Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate? On the corner rolling dice
Punishment, but I've done nothing wrong
In my eyes, who really pays the price

My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done
Sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got
Though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar, as I kneel down and I
Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of
the truth, whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right
off the roof, 'cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
but now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact that the majority
of the people are out there smoking crack, getting doped up,
shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a
question we all ask and must answer before long, 'cause no one
is safe in this world, what's the deal, the sentence is death and to
what court do I appeal?

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

Punishment","God save the queen

"People always wanna know 
The reason for what they consider senseless violence in the hood
I'ma break it down for you 
This is why we ride

And this is why we ride
And this is why we ride

I gotta say this clear, I gotta say this loud
I should've been dead, don't know how I'm here now
I should've been dead, damn it forty years ago
How the f*ck did I survive? Something that I'll never know
I played the crack game, gang bang, guns
Motherfuckers told me I'd never see twenty one

I come from LA, deep in the heart of the hood
Every night the bullets fly, this shit ain't Hollywood
Could be your best friend, mother or brother dead
Cops can't do shit, these streets are blood red
So we leave the block and we load the guns
And we want revenge, until revenge comes

And this is why we ride

And this is why we ride

I made it out the hood, I got a great life
But them bullets fly every motherfucking night
Another kid dies every motherfucking night
Another mother cries every motherfucking night
Ghettoes of deep crack, made to never escape
A place to store the poor, made to never escape
They're all over the world, people go to die
Murders go unsolved, I understand why
They remove hope and then we sell dope
Pain in poverty has us at each other's throat
Families are broken and so we gang bang
A bit form of unity but most love some of us ever seen

And this is how we die

And this is why we ride

Oh man, coming up and surviving in the ghetto
The smallest argument goes from little drama to big drama 
Next thing you know, somebody's dead
I don't think you can understand if you've never been in your streets 
And held your best friend in your arms
Your child in your arms and watch them breathe their last breath 
'Cause somebody shot them dead in the streets 
You ain't thinking of calling the police
You want revenge and you want it now 
I gotta be honest with you 
If somebody were to kill me, shoot me right now, 
My last words wouldn't be peace 
It would be get those motherfuckers

(And this is why we ride)

This song is dedicated to all of you who has lost somebody to street violence

And this is why we ride

And this is how we die","Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh

Well it's another one, in the gutter one, ghetto running em
Troublesome, extra double dumb, I come to beat em
Defeat em and mistreat em, so what if that I'm cheating
Now everybody wanna sound grimey (yeah I know)
I'ma show ya how, come on, all in together now
Yeah oh yeah yeah that's how it gotta be
So stop trying to be loud as me 'cause you can't do that
Think about it, playing Russian roulette with an automatic
I bet my ass against the line the last bullet's first on line
Stab and step and repping and run, packing a weapon is wild
Peace to the brother's on Rikers Isle
Tough enough and trembling, blend in like a chameleon

Strictly swift blast of the raspy-rasp fashion
That I provide, I abide the U.S.G
Besides the ghetto vibe, make me flip like Jekyll and Hyde
Of course, I come across with the pure for sure unadulterated uncut raw
Disgusted, busted, you wanna touch it, too hot
You forgot, you're not ready, your head could get ruptured
Hit between the eyes, I plan to vandalize
I supply the static, I run with the bad guys
The villains, crooks, highlighters and the fighters
See the big black picture if you look inside of my mind
It's graphic, expressed it drastic
So kill the copycat act kid, it's all mastered
Directed it, when y'all least expected it
And thought it was safe, Onyx hit you in the face so slam

I'm a b-boy, standing in my b-boy stance
Hurry up and give me the microphone before I bust in my pants
The mad author of anguish, my language polluted
Onyx is heavyweight and still undisputed
You took the words right out my mouth now walk a mile in my shoes
I paid so many dues, I feel used and abused and I'm so confused
Excuse me, for example I'm an inspiration of a whole generation
And unless you got ten sticky fingers it's an imitation
A figment of your imagination
Bu-bu-bu-but wait it gets worse
I'm not watered down so I'm dying of thirst
Coming through with a scam, foolproof plan
B-boys make some noise, and just, just slam

I spent my days up, my nights up, it's too hard to sleep
Look at my face, it's not the one of someone at peace
I carry guns when I don't need to, but my mind's so fucked
I see assassins coming out of the rough
I keep my doors locked, windows shut, shades down, so pound
Waiting on some Satans who may think of invading
When I do sleep I dream about pain and unrest
About gunfights and dum-dums exploding my chest
I see my boys that've died sitting with me again
And when I wake I realize that I've lost most of my friends
Will my past come back to get me?

Why do you find it so hard to believe I've got none for you
It's my heart and my mind that I'll always follow, I will not break
Nor will my balls, although that I've seen that you've tried
before
Why are people fake?

I see the world in a different light
Things not always black and white
Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey

I would never try and tell you what was right from wrong
Maybe that's why you feel that I don't belong
Always put me down for things I've said and done
Can't you see it's a war that can't be won

A war that can't be won

Living in your world seems so clear and concise
Shutting out reality makes everything so nice
Paint a pretty picture black and white everyday
See my tattered canvass bleeding shades of grey

I see the world in a different light
Things not always black and white
Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey","Right now ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

I am an anarchist,
Don't know what I want
But I know how to get it
I want to destroy the passerby

'Cause I want to be anarchy,
No dogs body

Anarchy for the U.K.
It's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic line.
Your future dream is a shopping scheme

'Cause I want to be anarchy,
In the city

How many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the enemy.
I use anarchy

'Cause I want to be anarchy,
Its the only way to be

Is this the MPLA
Or is this the UDA
Or is this the IRA
I thought it was the U.K.
Or just another country
Another council tenancy.

I want to be anarchy
And I want to be anarchy

And l want to be an anarchist

"Another night I sit alone in the dark
I can't remember my name, I stalk streets and parks
Shame on the victims whose lifes intersect with mine
Massive contusions, rivers of crimson wine
Dismemberments is all that I'm remembering
Bloodstains, pieces of brains under my fingernails
Screams, kicks, fights, bruises, and yells
Nobody lives so nobody tells
I wake up in my house all alone
Bloody sheets, mud on my feet
Next to me, utensils of death, I can't front son
Knives, razor blades, axes, and guns
Look in my chest, I got this ill ass cut
I get the needle and thread and sew it up
Raise the shades and it's night again
You'll hear the shouts

Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out

Two ladies out late walking their dogs
They're old, the city is damned from the fault
I approach from the back with the speed of a shark
Cloaked by dark, I rip their backs apart
The violence is incredibly sexual to me
I'm a blood fiend, makes me bust nuts in my jeans
Yeah, I think I want to keep their heads
I love to peel off their faces and wear their dead skin to bed
The dogs bark and bite at my feet
As I leave they drag their headless bodies down the street
I make it home, take a bath
The water turns red in the aftermath
I wake again and it's night
I passed out, no doubt

Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out

Make it stop
Make the voices stop
Make it stop, please
Stop

My mind echoes with voices of terror
My next victim is in the mirror
Seems like I've seen him before, I can't quite recollect
All I know is that the voices say ""Slice his neck""
I cut off his hand, the blood sprayed from his wrist
And burst, it felt warm when it quenched my thirst
I stabbed him in the eye with my knife made of surgical steel
Oh what a feel
Electrical shocks ripped my brain
Pain like I never felt before, sweet pain
I love it, I love it and I want more
Pulled out my straight razor blade in his juggular
I'm looking at the ceiling now
I wonder where he went and how
He couldn't escape, not in that state
I transcended through the gates of hell and met my soul mate
South of heaven and the devil is my final vouch
You'll hear the shouts

Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out","""Free people will never remain free if they are not willing, if

Officer Vinson was in plain clothes when the shooting happened
He was not wearing a body worn camera

To be grateful, take nothing for granted, to live the truth as best I can.

I seek the truth whatever that may be,
I seek the answers to questions, please God help me.

To look at people and see no color, vision clear of prejudice or spite,
To treat people just like my brother, for this I pray with all my might.
To learn to let go of all my fears and learn to embrace all of my tears,
To search for faith and humility, to walk the path which sets me free.

Salvation, from society, damnation, have mercy on me.

So far away from who I am I never understand.
So many things I regret, so many things that I let
Take me away from myself, too late to take it back.

So many dreams I had, so many lives I've lived
So many friends I said goodbye forever
So many times I wish, so many times I dream,
Do it again, I swear I'd never.

As I seek serenity from the war, from the war inside my mind.","God save the queen

Yeah, I think I want to keep their heads
I love to peel off their faces and wear their dead skin to bed
The dogs bark and bite at my feet
As I leave they drag their headless bodies down the street
I make it home, take a bath
The water turns red in the aftermath
I wake again and it's night
I passed out, no doubt

Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out

Make it stop
Make the voices stop
Make it stop, please
Stop

My mind echoes with voices of terror
My next victim is in the mirror
Seems like I've seen him before, I can't quite recollect
All I know is that the voices say ""Slice his neck""
I cut off his hand, the blood sprayed from his wrist
And burst, it felt warm when it quenched my thirst
I stabbed him in the eye with my knife made of surgical steel
Oh what a feel
Electrical shocks ripped my brain
Pain like I never felt before, sweet pain
I love it, I love it and I want more
Pulled out my straight razor blade in his juggular
I'm looking at the ceiling now
I wonder where he went and how
He couldn't escape, not in that state
I transcended through the gates of hell and met my soul mate
South of heaven and the devil is my final vouch
You'll hear the shouts

Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out","I question not me, it only happens to others

"Since the beginning of time, humans have killed each other because they disagree
The human is the only animal that actually kills for sport
The ability to kill is as innate as our ability to love
When someone hurts me I want revenge, I want them in pain, I want them dead

I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust

I'm a carnivore, I can eat meat raw
I destroy almost everything I touch
I got a quick fuse, trip and I murder you
And forget you, more bullets the better
I can't explain it though, it makes me feel good
Zombie apocalypse, I live for the gore
Give me suicide, serial massacre
Execution yo, I always want more
I love the punishment, I love to dish it out
I want blood, motherfuck a submission
It's deep inside of me, violent tendencies
Like a scalpel when it makes its incision

I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust

I've got a love (It's a lust for blood)
I've got a love (It's a lust for blood)
I've got a love (It's a lust for blood)
I've got a love

Sometimes I wonder am I somehow aroused by this shit
Then I wonder why certain people are pleased by others' pain

I've always had this, this ain't nothing new
This fucking sickness, probably the same as you
I love brutality, it makes my pulse rot
I mean fatality, bodies in dark skies
It's in my DNA, I don't care what you think
It's running through my veins, animal instinct
Make me mad, I want you to die
Different politics, millions of homicides
I get my rocks off letting these Glocks off
Cross me wrong, get your ass crossed up
I'm the human species, the most violent on Earth
I killed my own planet, I'm so sick that it hurts

I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust","Biohazard - Sellout Lyrics 
So many times I've been lied to, blind to
The ways of the world I've been lied to, blind to
I never understand how this master plan speaking man to man
Could ever give a damn
Hypocritical stance don't make me piss in my pants
You never care unless there's money to make
I'll never sacrifice, I got no time in my life

You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

You never understand exactly what kind of man that I am

You think I envy your life but you never realize I always live the
 way that I
choose
Feel so much regret but you never let
That make you live the truth
You point fingers and lie, the harsh truth you deny
Life is a game that you don't want to lose

You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

the one you really want to live your life through

Pray for death

Your screams will make me come 
Your useless pleads for mercy

I dismember you slowly and feel your heart pound

Tied down in a motherfucking chair 
Oh, look at you, you're crying now, you're sorry now

Stupid motherfucker, you thought you would last
Well took the wrong path, now your name is in the past

Another fuckin' lowlife connected to the first
A crooked cop on the take, nothing could be worse
Twenty one gun salute, the widow lays the wreath
The whole police department covered up he was a thief

Never tought the day would come, bang, a fuckin' hit

Did you control your own life or greed controlled you
For the lives that you destroyed, so morally depraved
For the people you left grieving, I spit on your grave

I see the world in a different light
Things not always black and white
Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey

I would never try and tell you what was right from wrong
Maybe that's why you feel that I don't belong
Always put me down for things I've said and done
Can't you see it's a war that can't be won

A war that can't be won

Living in your world seems so clear and concise
Shutting out reality makes everything so nice
Paint a pretty picture black and white everyday
See my tattered canvass bleeding shades of grey

I see the world in a different light
Things not always black and white
Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey","God save the queen

They made you a moron
A potential H bomb

There's no future
No future

"Once upon a time

I think about what man hood use to mean
How men had to stand for something 
Man like my father, real men 
Men had to be about something 
Men had to give a f*ck 
Men had to power through it
A man just can't give up

Then bitch get on your knees 

I will not lose 

I will not lose 

So what's the problem yo, every man is turning bitch 
How will I solve it yo? Duct tape and a shallow ditch

Tell me what is good for me and my career

Doing as you're told, puppets of the big machine
Changing faces, revolving door hypocrisy
Who do you work for now, yeah, I see

[Chorus I:]

Music's for you and me
Not the fucking industry
You fucking tell us what is cool
You see we came from different schools

You got no crowd but you got a big push
Kissing asses till your pride turns into mush
You might change your style for the record company
Fingers down your throat, you heave your integrity

You're weak, give it up, throw the towel and the flag in
And get your pussy ass of the motherfuckin' bandwagon
Never for a minute were you real in the first place
So far up someone's ass you got shit on your face

[Chorus II:]

Music's for you and me
Not the fucking industry
You fucking tell us what is cool
You see we came from different schools
To us it matters what you say
Not the fucking games you play
You're full of shit, it's plain to see
The whole damn fucking indrusty

If you think for a minute this song's about you
Step the f*ck back, 'cause it's probably true
The message in the music is the reason that we're in this
Music is for you and me, not the fucking industry

It only matters what you say, not the fuckin' games you play
Full of shit, it's plain to see, the whole damn fuckin' industry

Listen up, I'll give you a for instance
People go hating for the color of skin
Won't they learn they'll never win
Play not the hands of the media vultures
We must learn to unite our cultures
Violence constantly tears us apart
Show the world that we've got heart

[Chorus:]

Blood is spilled on black and white
Different colors, why do we fight
Face the facts, stone cold sober
Black and white and red all over

Thousands die and kill each other
Someone rapes and stabs their mother
I think it'ssick to count the death toll
On and on the media rolls
Drive by shootings, homicide
Nobody cares about the mother who cried
A family's grief stepped on by ratings
Understand why I keep hating

It makes no sense for us to be pawns
In the chess game that the media plays

If the streets are where you run
There you die, why? Find yourself a way out

Black and white and red all over

Ruling out the positive and any hope for peace
This will only kill morale, paper sales increase
This shit has got to cease

Black and white and red all over

Believe half of what you read and half what you see
Put two and two together and you'll have reality
Can't you see my reality?

[Chorus]

Turn on the TV and what do I see
Killing, murder and blasphemy
Rape, arsan, robberies
People die of incurable disease
Crashes, bashes, people on crack

Always strife in the middle fucking east

F*ck, a vegan! 

I couldn't give a f*ck if you eat sawdust, motherfucker 
Just step away from my fucking sandwich!

I'm gonna f*ck you all night

She took me back to her cold crib, dark and scary
Connected to a cemetery
I couldn't fuckin' breathe
And then she pushed up again

And said: come here, boy
I show you how to do it right
You think you know about sex
But you don't know shit
I'm gonna f*ck you all night

Sex black voodoo, sex black voodoo, sex black voodoo
Sex black voodoo, sex black voodoo,sex black voodoo
Sex black voodoo, sex
Please God help me

She pushed me back in the bed
With her blood red
Then she did some voodoo shit
And then he started to sweat
Her body was soaking wet

She said:come here boy
I show you how to do it right
You think you know about sex
But you don't know shit
I'm gonna f*ck you all night

Hold on, w.t.f. is that hit?
Is that a knife?
Bitch,is that a knife
Is that real blood?
Hold on, bitch you're crazy
Black voodoo sex","I sit and pick my brain each night
With an axe in my hand held tight
Bite my nose to spite my face
Killing myself, I can't escape the rat race
Wallowing in neck-deep misery
Quicksand dissent, pressure free
Deepest wounds are self inflicted
Should I hope to be vindicated

Always alone, society's abortion
Self mutilation, the daily partion
Resentful past breeds hopeful future
With tears of blood, I remove the sutures

Dying inside, emotions they hide
Irreparable damage from the tears that I've cried
I climb from the sewer, the years that I have
spent
Self mutilation or my environment

[Chorus: Repeat x2]
Tears of blood, tears of blood
I cry, I cry
Tears of blood, tears of blood
I die

Deny myself for fear of being
Is it over now, has my heart stopped beating
Lying here just self defeating
My mind is empty, it won't stop bleeding
Twisted anger screams my brain
Over the edge, I hang in pain
Mouth locked shut my mind won't swallow
With tears of blood alone I wallow

No one to blame except myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Maybe its just a matter of pride
Too sweet to end with suicide

Peel the scab, pour salt in the wound
Torturing myself, I'm forever doomed
Looking east and west each and every moon
A peaceful rest comes somebody soon

No one to blame expect myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Is death life and do we live in hell?

[Chorus: Repeat x3]","There's no point in asking
You'll get no reply
Oh just remember a don't decide
I got no reason it's all too much
You'll always find us
Out to lunch

We're vacant
Oh we're so pretty

A-vacant

Don't ask us to attend
Cause we're not all there

You can see it in his face, he's a weak and sad man
Staring straight ahead, his eyes set like stone

So what'cha gonna do you'll be dead in a minute
Thinking slow will get you nowhere fast

You live like that, you die like this
That's how it is
Livin' with regret is no way to live
That's how it is
You're dead too soon if the bullet don't miss
That's how it is kid
How it is
That's what you get for
Living like this
With a bullet in your head, you're dead, you can't miss
Ain't no time for regret when you're body is in a bag
Ain't no time to change your mind when your head begins to sag
Should've known better, ain't working for you now
Maybe if you'd know better you'd be here somehow
So change your ways before you ways change you
With a hole in your head that you can see through
You're looking up and you're looking down
Shot's are rippin' out from all around
You're crying out for help but it can't be found

You want to cover us in the margarine

To have real eyes

Down down down down
And I´ll take you down on the underground
Down in the dark and down in the crypt
Down in the dark where the typewriter fit

Down with your pen and pad ready to kill
To make me ill

Make it as someone you want to be me ruin me

"This song is dedicated to the heroes, the real heroes
Young men and women that have given their lives
And risked their lives for this country
Taught you everything, dropped out of school at 17
Trying to get a job at an early age
But no diploma means minimum wage
Bumped into a military recruiter
Said the same, no game, no first person shooter
With high-school you missed it
So that day you're enlisted
First day off the
Basic training, scared as f*ck
Thrill instructors, demons from hell
You never forget what you hear and yell
Six minutes of torture drives you insane
March, run, march, train
You're asking yourself why the f*ck you came
Lock them all thirty rounds, watch your lane

Been through a unit, company, squad
You finally get a break cause training its hard
You meet your new fam, the platoon men
You bond with them, they become your boys
Two months later you're all deployed
Now damn rain, shit gets real
Enemy shoot back, confirm your kills
You learn firsthand, PTST,
Your best friends kill, by IED
You watch your whole team get blown apart
You catch a frag in a purple heart
You write back home, you lost your pride
This struggle with God is a suicide
To this country you gave your life
And we must respect your sacrifice

No one wanted to pick people out of a crowd and line them up for execution,
Neither did they relish the possible consequences of an enraged public upon
Discovering that they were being systematically murdered. A very short but
Very deadly global war was contemplated. Something else had to be done that
Would absolve the decision-makers of guilt, something that could be blamed
Upon Mother Nature. The answer, a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
Does not naturally exist for which no natural immunity could have been acquired.
The United States population was infected. The vaccine was administered by the
World health organization. Whatever causes AIDS was in the vaccine
I'm the first in line with a sentence on death row
Take a look around and feel the wind blow
And to those motherfuckers who decide our fate
Annihilate, come together and kill their hate
Cut their heads off and put 'em on a stake
Stuff their bodies in a barrel and throw 'em in the lake
Let the leaches feast on their own
Motherfucker you're wrong, your on your own

[Chorus]
We all go to fight for our rights
Stand against those opposed
We all go to fight for our rights

Population control 
Population control

Over population is the most serious threat to the whole future of our species.

Rip their arms off from limb to limb
Make them regret they thought they would win
Cut their tongues out to stop spreading lies
Their poisonous venom has kept me blind
Open your eyes don't you realize
Come together, it's time we rise

The vaccine was administered by the world health organization.

That enough people have died.","Look at that

People I've met and places I've been
Inconceivable how one maintains
In the game with the pain and the strain on the brain
How reality's plane can wear you down
And make you an insane man who only frowns
City hardened and cold just like me
Anger has numbed my eyes from all they see
From all they see

Like a workingman's skin as it turns to leather
The mind of the youth is forced to weather
An assault on his senses by his parents and peers
That preys on innocence, weakness and fears
Manifestation of rage runs deep
Over the edge of sanity, thoughts creep
Violent reaction, bitter and mean
A product of what these eyes have seen

These eyes have seen inhuman sights
I hold my breath with all my might
Like anyone else in our own hells
It seems obscene, the things I've seen
I hold my breath with all my might
These eyes have seen inhuman sights

Lost count of how many wakes were attended
Mind and body never quite mended
Do you think this is what life intended?
At fourteen your life has ended
Maybe your spirit is battered and broken
From shit you've seen and words that were spoken
Death, violence, drugs all around
These eyes have seen some shit go down

These eyes have seen inhuman sights
I hold my breath with all my might
Like anyone else in our own hells
It seems obscene, the things I've seen","""C'mon Everybody""

Ooh! C'mon everybody

Oh well, my baby's number one
But I'm gonna dance with three or four
And the house will be shakin' from the bare feet
A-stampin' on the floor

Well when you here the music, you can't still
If your brother won't rock, your sister will
Ooh! C'mon everybody

Oh well, we really haven't money
But we gotta put a guard outside
If the folks come home
I'm afraid, they're gonna have my hide
There'd be no more movies for a week or two
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew-who cares?

I know you creep
Your knives are stuck in my back so deep,
The pain is killing me

A goddam disgrace!
Lies, lies, lies, lies
Straight to my fucking face!
I hate you with all my heart right now,
The simple sight of makes me sick.
What kind of fucking fool do you take me for,
I'm done with your shit.
I gotta follow my soul right now,
I gotta move to my evil side.
No longer can I handle your torture,
Tonight may be your last night.

[Chorus]

""You know the sex didn't bother me
The fact you may have been with other men
It was your ability to lie to me.
Look me dead in the eye and tell the lie.
I should, kill you for that.
I've killed many men for less""

Life disappears, get's blown away
New world chaos in disarray
A second to die and forever to pray
The time has come to push to fight, to die, to live
This time I take the fall
Don't sort them out just kill them all
Just never push my back against the wall
Beaten senseless, violent relentless
No hope defenseless, beaten senseless
Now you pushed me over the edge
Can't take it no more, I'm seeing red
Beaten senseless over the head
Never gonna stop until your all fucking dead
Vengeance is my only thought
Rage, abuse, the wars I've fought
Self preservation is self taught
Turn your back and you'll be caught
Crushing pain intensity a violent beating senselessly so cruel, agony
Broken spirit, broken home,
A broken man who can not cope with pain, misery
","I'm on a submarine mission for you baby
I feel the way you were going
I picked you up on my TV screen
I feel your undercurrent flowing

You've pot me pretty deep baby
I can't figure out your watery love
I gotta solve your mystery
You're sitting if out in heaven above

I can't deny reality as lite gets smothered

If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
'Cause he who paints the big picture
Runs the whole scene

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous, am I better off dead?

Punishment for all my sins

A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind

Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate on the corner rolling dice
Punishment but I've done nothing wrong in my eyes
Who really pays the fucking price

My lament for the human race
Guilty punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done, sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar
As I kneel down and I confess to the Father
That I'm suffering a burning question of the truth
Whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right off the roof
'Cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
But now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact
That the majority of the people are out there smoking crack
Getting doped up, shooting that shit into their veins
The question must be asked if we have any brains left

Or right or wrong in this song
A question we all ask and must answer before long
'Cause no one is safe in this world, what's the deal
The sentence is death and to what court do I appeal?

So many times I've been lied to, blind to
The ways of the world I've been lied to, blind to
I never understand how this master plan speaking man to man
Could ever give a damn
Hypocritical stance don't make me piss in my pants
You never care unless there's money to make
I'll never sacrifice, I got no time in my life
To f*ck around with something that I know is fake
You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

You never understand exactly what kind of man that I am
'till you wear my shoes
You think I envy your life but you never realize I always live the
 way that I
choose
Feel so much regret but you never let
That make you live the truth
You point fingers and lie, the harsh truth you deny
Life is a game that you don't want to lose

You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

and be the one you disrespect and lie to
the one you really want to live your life through
the soul you sell is really your own
because I'm the only one you can never lie to

Doing much of the same way, real, I never did it for fame or glory

For all these years, with no respect from my peers
I kept it real and told my story
Sellout-This shit is real and I can never be fake
I'll do whatever it takes within reason
Sellout-Made so many mistakes, never caught any breaks
I live and die for whatever I believe in

Sellout-You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

the one you really want to live your life through
the soul you sell is really your own

Well I've been doin' my homework all week long
Now to have some fifty and my folk are gone
Ooh! C'mon everybody

Oh well, my baby's number one
But I'm gonna dance with three or four
And the house will be shakin' from the bare feet
A-stampin' on the floor

Well when you here the music, you can't still
If your brother won't rock, your sister will
Ooh! C'mon everybody

Oh well, we really haven't money
But we gotta put a guard outside
If the folks come home
I'm afraid, they're gonna have my hide
There'd be no more movies for a week or two
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew-who cares?
C'mon everybody"
"Aw yeah, what's up out there? BC's in the house. Right
About now, I want to tell you a little love story, you know
What I'm sayin', this is a Body Count love story check out
The lyrics, you know, I'm a tell you 'bout what happened
When we went down South last year on tour.

Out on tour yo, I been all around the world
Went to Georgia, met this fine-assed white girl,
Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits and thighs,
The kinda girl that would knock out most guys.
She got wild in the backstage bathroom,
Sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum,
Said ""I love you, but my daddy don't play,
He's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK.""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

You know what I'm sayin'. So we was down South fallin' in
Love, you know, D-Roc had this Nazi girl, my man
Mooseman had a skinhead, I fell in love with Tipper Gore's
Two twelve year old nieces. It was wild, you know what I'm
Sayin', it got even worse, you know.

So one night they took us to a meetin'
White sheets, white hoods, no room for seatin'
There was Skinheads, Nazi's and crazies,
Talkin' 'bout black people pushin' up daisies.
They hated Blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans,
Mexicans, Chinese, even the Indians.
We had our hoods on,
We were slick
She pushed her butt up hard against my dick.
Then her daddy jumped on the stage
Talkin' 'bout killin' in a goddamn rage.
I got mad, my dick got hard
Entered in her ass
She said, ""Oh my God!""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves
Everybody. We love Mexican girls, Black girls, Oriental girls,
It really don't matter. If you from Mars, and you got a pussy,
We will f*ck you. You know, that's all we're sayin', word.

So every year when Body Count comes around
We throw an orgy in every little Southern town.
KKK's, Skinheads, and Nazi
Girls break their necks
To get to the party.
It ain't like their men can't nut,
Their dick's too little
And they just can't f*ck.
So we get buck wild with the white freaks
We show them how to really work the white sheets.
I know her daddy'll really be after me,
When his grandson's named little Ice-T.

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.","Population control. The only alternative left was to increase the death rate,
No one wanted to pick people out of a crowd and line them up for execution,
Neither did they relish the possible consequences of an enraged public upon
Discovering that they were being systematically murdered. A very short but
Very deadly global war was contemplated. Something else had to be done that
Would absolve the decision-makers of guilt, something that could be blamed
Upon Mother Nature. The answer, a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
Does not naturally exist for which no natural immunity could have been acquired.
The United States population was infected. The vaccine was administered by the
World health organization. Whatever causes AIDS was in the vaccine
I'm the first in line with a sentence on death row
Take a look around and feel the wind blow
And to those motherfuckers who decide our fate
Annihilate, come together and kill their hate
Cut their heads off and put 'em on a stake
Stuff their bodies in a barrel and throw 'em in the lake
Let the leaches feast on their own

Stand against those opposed

Over population is the most serious threat to the whole future of our species.

Come together, it's time we rise

Wide awake I open my eyes into a nightmare of a life that I despise I gotta,
break it down to the bare essentials 'cause life's too short to be sentimental.
Twisting around inside my head so many crazy visions - am I better off dead?
Filled with dread - gun under the bed to clip all the motherfuckers trying
to keep me down, I ain't fuckin' around.
Wide awake my eyes are open I can't breathe my heart is choking and I can't speak
the words unspoken and I can't believe my life is broken again... (my life is broken)

Keep trying to tell myself ""everything will be OK, everything will go my way""
'till life steps in and slaps on the strangle, tears flow and fists start to mangle.
I wake up screaming everyday, nobody pays attention when I'm writhing in pain,
I got a glitch in my brain I gotta break free from anxiety, I gotta let go of life
'cause it's killing me

She held the doll in the air (Voodoo)
She took the scissors,
Cut off all its fingers!
Ah!
My fingers, bitch!

Ah!

Voodoo, Voodoo

So if you're ever down in New Orleans, yeah.
You might meet an old lady
She might have a doll
It might look like you.

[Chorus]
Bring it on, here comes the mutherfucking pain
There's a war in my, I can't take the strain
Insane in the brain runnin like a freight train
I feel no remorse, I feel no pain
I'm the punisher kid an I'm taking you out
Say you prayers son, it's the final death bout
If I gotta take you out it don't mean a thing
I'll be the last man standing

[Chorus]

Southside vato, anybody killer
Body baggin fools try to scheme for the skriller
I kill like old patrone tequila
Your ass will be next if you try to deliver
Any actions that are pre-meditated
Snuff whole crews 'cause that shit is out dated
Bring my enemies to his knees and I'm blasting
Sen Dog will be the last man standing

[Chorus]

My blood starts pumping, racin through my veins
I'm a cold blooded killah stalking my prey
The taste of blood gets me high
I'll fight to the finish, I'll fight till I die

I rise and stand against anybody or anything
In the end I will be, I'll be the last man standing

I'm gonna crash and bash and smash and bust your ass in half
Feel the wrath, I'll blast you if I have to
So bow down, respect to the master
I'm the last man and my name is Disaster

[Chorus]","I don't mind the things that you say
I don't even mind going out of my way
I try and do these things for you
Why should I do it I'm always untrue

Well, I did you no wrong
I did you no wrong

I ain't seen you off the screen
But those films are my dreams
And I can't take much more of you
'Cause the bog is no place to see your face

Oh can't you see going out of my head

I can't deny reality as life gets smothered

If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
Cause he who paints the big picture runs the whole scene

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous? Am I better off dead?

Punishment, for all my sins

A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind

Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate? On the corner rolling dice
Punishment, but I've done nothing wrong
In my eyes, who really pays the price

My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done
Sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got
Though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar, as I kneel down and I
Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of
the truth, whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right
off the roof, 'cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
but now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact that the majority
of the people are out there smoking crack, getting doped up,
shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a
question we all ask and must answer before long, 'cause no one
is safe in this world, what's the deal, the sentence is death and to
what court do I appeal?

Welcome to the rat race, people killing themselves
To get ahead of the pack, backstab and attack.
Out for self, the money, the power, the fame,
Competition and greed in a world without shame.
I stumble and fall along the path I've chosen,
I face my fears, I won't be broken.
Corrosion has a way of fucking with your sanity,
I do what I gotta to preserve my humanity.

Switchback - taking life as each day comes
Switchback - facing fears, I never run,
Switchback - never quit until I'm done
I'm the underdong and I will overcome.

Confrontation can break you down to your very fast compound.
Beat you down, drag you round, break you
Refuse to bend, never ever let it take you
Over the edge where you can never break through.
Overcome, switchback, stand strong alone
The good, the bad, the truth, the unknown
Locked up at war with the demons within
I fight to live, I live to win.

The harder that I battle with lifes deceit,
The stronger I stand on my own two feet.
If I allow the world to assimilate my mind,
Will my freedom be forever denied?
Will I no longer be free in my mind?","I don't want to holiday in the sun

The only choice is suicide

No escape

No one's ever escaped

To turn my anger into love and keep my feet planted on the ground.
To undo stigmas societies branded, misconceptions about being a man.
To be grateful, take nothing for granted, to live the truth as best I can.

I seek the truth whatever that may be,
I seek the answers to questions, please God help me.

To look at people and see no color, vision clear of prejudice or spite,
To treat people just like my brother, for this I pray with all my might.
To learn to let go of all my fears and learn to embrace all of my tears,
To search for faith and humility, to walk the path which sets me free.

Salvation, from society, damnation, have mercy on me.

So many lies I told, so many lives I've sold.
So far away from who I am I never understand.
So many things I regret, so many things that I let
Take me away from myself, too late to take it back.

So many dreams I had, so many lives I've lived
So many friends I said goodbye forever
So many times I wish, so many times I dream,
Do it again, I swear I'd never.

In my quest to uncover the truth the deepest wounds get left behind
As I seek serenity from the war, from the war inside my mind.","Suburban kid, ya got no name

There, there, there, there goes the neighborhood.","See the future, hate being unsure
Feel insecure, life without a cure
Invade my body like it was your own
A losing battle when challenged alone.

I'm sick and tired of losing someone I love and admire
I'm fucking tired of losing someone like you.

How can you feel it unless it happens to you?
Watching someone suffer there's nothing you can do.
Sit and wait with love and hate, emotions, they destroy,
I question my faith, how can a God, how can a God take?

How can I worship a God who takes life away
And leaves nothing but pain that never goes away.
I lie in bed each night, struggle to fall asleep,
Memories in my head, i pray my soul to keep.
Tried and true, I get up everyday and say,
Life's too short, no time to look the other way.
Gotta face what's inside, I gotta do away
With all the feelings behind my frozen heart, I pray.","Too many problems
Oh why am I here
I need to be me
'Cause you're all too clear
And I can see
There's something wrong with you
But what do you expect me to do?
At least I gotta know what I wanna be
Don't come to me if you need pity
Are you lonely you got no one
You get your body in suspension
That's no problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you

Eat your heart out on a plastic tray
You don't do what you want
Then you'll fade away
You won't find me working
Nine to five
It's too much fun a being alive
I'm using my feet for my human machine
You won't find me living for the screen
Are you lonely all your needs catered
You got your brains dehydrated

Problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you
What you gonna do

Problem, problem

Problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you
What you gonna do with your problem
The problem is you

I ain't equipment, I ain't automatic
You won't find me just staying static
Don't you give me any orders
For people like me
There is no order

Bet you thought you knew what I was about
Bet you thought you'd solved all your problems
But you are the problem

Problem, problem
Problem, the problem is you
What you gonna do with your problem
I'll leave it to you
Problem, the problem is you
You got a problem
What you gonna do

They know a doctor
Gonna take you away
They take you away
And throw away the key
They don't want you
And they don't want me

"Aw yeah, what's up out there? BC's in the house. Right
About now, I want to tell you a little love story, you know
What I'm sayin', this is a Body Count love story check out
The lyrics, you know, I'm a tell you 'bout what happened
When we went down South last year on tour.

Out on tour yo, I been all around the world
Went to Georgia, met this fine-assed white girl,
Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits and thighs,
The kinda girl that would knock out most guys.
She got wild in the backstage bathroom,
Sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum,
Said ""I love you, but my daddy don't play,
He's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK.""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

You know what I'm sayin'. So we was down South fallin' in
Love, you know, D-Roc had this Nazi girl, my man
Mooseman had a skinhead, I fell in love with Tipper Gore's
Two twelve year old nieces. It was wild, you know what I'm
Sayin', it got even worse, you know.

So one night they took us to a meetin'
White sheets, white hoods, no room for seatin'
There was Skinheads, Nazi's and crazies,
Talkin' 'bout black people pushin' up daisies.
They hated Blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans,
Mexicans, Chinese, even the Indians.
We had our hoods on,
We were slick
She pushed her butt up hard against my dick.
Then her daddy jumped on the stage
Talkin' 'bout killin' in a goddamn rage.
I got mad, my dick got hard
Entered in her ass
She said, ""Oh my God!""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves
Everybody. We love Mexican girls, Black girls, Oriental girls,
It really don't matter. If you from Mars, and you got a pussy,
We will f*ck you. You know, that's all we're sayin', word.

So every year when Body Count comes around
We throw an orgy in every little Southern town.
KKK's, Skinheads, and Nazi
Girls break their necks
To get to the party.
It ain't like their men can't nut,
Their dick's too little
And they just can't f*ck.
So we get buck wild with the white freaks
We show them how to really work the white sheets.
I know her daddy'll really be after me,
When his grandson's named little Ice-T.

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.","I will never forget what it is that you did to me,
And I will never understand why
You insist upon inflicting pain and agony on me, forever everlasting.

There's no way out, I'll never break free
I will never forgive and forget how you abandoned me.

All my fucking life I've keep my head held high,
Respected myself through thick or thin,
Never asked anybody for anything.
I just want to live with peace and dignity
but you insist on trying to bring me down.

Where were you when I needed you,
You were never around.
I put my faith in you and you let me down.","Right now! 
I am an Antichrist
I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want but
I know how to get it
I want to destroy the passer by 'cause I

I want to be anarchy!

I give a wrong time stop a traffic line
Your future dream is the shopping scheme 'cause I

I want to be anarchy!

I use the enemy I use anarchy cause I

I want to be anarchy!

Or is this the u.d.a.

Get pissed destroy!"
"Look outside my window,
I still see a fucked up world
Waking up to helicopter and car alarams,
Does this happen where you live?
Gunshots sound in my my mind
I don't flinch anymore
When I see niggas in my hood,
They're holdin' their dicks tight

Yo, f*ck my landlord
I'm a step away from clearing this shotgun
To erase the problem
Does this happen where you live?
Just had steak and lobster last night
Now I gotta rob a liquor store
But it seems so normal
Because it's necessary evil

[Chorus]

Car hit my dog, babies die, raped in a
Stairwell, cop killed a little girl,
Armed robbery, shooter of a drive-by,
Smokin' cain, sellin' joints in jr High
Head from a minor, sex with animals,
Butthole surfers, a fucked up rehearsal,
Lost pawn ticket, wrecked my father's car
Can't pay my school loan, major jack move,
Holy underwear
Stuck in the pen, forced in a gang, plain
Wrapped food,
Fucked up presidents, sleepin' through trash day
Hit a police car, gettin' laid off, gotta pay
Taxes, gridlock traffic,
Jealous muthafuckas, bitch tried to do me,
Hit and run,
I got a fat bitch pregnant

Necessary evil

Little white kid with a cool-aid smile
Training wheels on his bike thought the
Called me a nigga
Pushed that little bastard in traffic so graphic,
He was holdin' his bike tight
He was a victim of fucked up explaining
An american example of fucked training
When the fuckin' bus connected, he flew like knievel
I was just necessary evil

[Chorus]

Necessary evil","Out of sight and out of mind, when you look at yourself do you find
Everything you want to be or do you see what I see.
Too late to change your life, step outside and say good-bye
To everything you left behind, what you seek you may not find.

As I shed my skin, I leave you behind
As I shed my skin, I go on to a better life.

Indecision fills my head, all the things I left unsaid,
My heart is letting go, my pain you'll never know.
If you love something set it free, what I love you took from me.
Try to look, but you can't see, try to put the past behind me.

How could you think it lasts forever, I sit and watch as you decline
Can't you see it's gone forever, out of sight and out of mind.

Twisted, broken, I sit and watch as you decline
Help me, help yourself, out of sight and out of mind.

I see you now in a different plane; broken, used up, pathetic, in pain,
You scream and fight, deny the shame, your selfish heart is the one to blame.
So much time has filled the space since we've been standing face to face.
Wasted breath I've tried to explain, still I see not a thing has changed.","There's no point in asking

[knock knock] Yeah 1,2,1,2 let me get this tape recorder rolling
Eh yeah this is eh Danny from Big Hair rock magazine, I'm here with Ice T, 
Eh Ice can we ask you a few questions about the new Body Count album?

 
Yeah, what is it, what what wa's up wa's up wa's up?


On the last album we didn't really feel that the group was up to par with today's metal standards.

 
Yeah whatever you know you know it's our second album you know we tried to bring you know get real, you know make you feel it...


Yeah well, I didn't feel it, I thought the guitar plaing was like a daisicle, the vocals were sub-standard.


Yeah well dude you know like we tried our best, you know what I'm sayin', we we we've been around the world, we did a lot of good shows, and a lot of people liked that last album.

 
Yeah but I mean me personally, I've been a metal head for years, I grew up on rock roll and I just didn't feel it.


Eh, yeah dude I understand what you're trying to-


I mean to be honest Ice T, I don't even think you should be in rock any more, I I I I can't feel what you do.


Eh yeah I understand man, but you know you're not-


Look Ice, I just don't feel what you guys are doin'.


Yeah dude, feel this! [shoots twice]
","Camouflage you close your eyes, hiding in plain sight
Wrapped tightly in blankets of lies, live whatever life you synthesize
Disguise the truth about yourself, bury it six feet deep,
Bring to life your deceit and stealth, lock the door and throw away the key.

Hide behind your lies, I seek through your disguise
It leads to your demise, I see it in your eyes.

Disarray your life slips into, falling apart at the seams,
You can't understand what's going on, who you once were is forever gone.
On and on the tangled web you weave, running from your past
You listen to whatever you want to believe
Too late karma comes around to you so fast.

All you do is lie, cheit deceive
Everyone you hate, need, believe
All you do is lie.

Tighten the noose around your neck is ripping,

How can a troubled government make us scapegoats
When we don't go out and vote.
We're spewing, spouting, condemnation

That the world we live in is a racist nation
Since our opinions contradict our statements,
We show our prejudiced affliliations.

Decline of civilization
A crime against humanity,
In all our lies and our self pity
It's time to stop our apathy.

You say you're a victim in pain
But you always prey on someone to blame.
You want to end the suffering for the hungry and the poor
When they ask for help you slam the door.
You want housing for the public good
But not in your own neighbourhood.
Industrial pollution makes you sick,
But you ain't got time for politics.

You want the world to be a better place
For your children, your people, your friends or race,
But selfish reasons drive us all, it's all for none and none for all.

Of the things in life that were taken away from you.
So wrapped up in your misery, you never feel the love that surrounds you,
So wrapped up in your misery, you never notice that life passed you by.

You've waited all your life for the pain to go away
Lock yourself inside a world that makes you hate.

Left it all alone, ignored by the one you need attention from
For the things in life you never achieved on your own.
He can't be bothered to care for you, to hold and respect and be there for you,
He can't be a real father to you, some day he'll regret all time that went by.

You've waited all your life for the pain to go away
And I've always hated to see you hurt inside.
So much I try to help but you push me away,
Lock yourself inside a world that makes you hate
Locked inside a world of hate.

Beaten down for as long as you remember
Your life was analyzed, criticized and dismembered
Your hopes and dreams were discouraged and severed
the pain you've endured, the suffering you've weathered
You find it so hard to pull yourself together
To face the world to your fears you surrender,
You dream of a day you'll overcome and sever,
The cycle of abuse and the pain you've carried forever.

You're not alone, there's so many others that care for you,
So many things in our lives you helped us all get through
It means so much to me that you're here to share in my life
And calm my tears, it means so much to me that you're alive,
As you hold my child and wipe the tears from your eyes.","Suburban kid, ya got no name

Thermonuclear warhead, chemical warfare, disease widespread.
People kneel to the might of a figure head, mother earth lies silent on
her death bed
Into the fire the blind are led, five billion people will soon be dead.

War is no solution to the conflicts that we face
The end of our evolution, revolution, resist the hand of fate.

Armageddon, the end draws near, reality becomes our biggest fear
The future once seemed so free and clear, darkest hour, life disappears.
Punishment for greed and lust, mass genocide, holocaust
Foretold predictions of the end upon us, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

We wage a ware which can't be won,
Apocalyptic suicide, what have we done?

Fire, one day a great fire shall come
Rain, a cleansing rain will wash away the scum
War, blood thirsty savages we've become
Revelation, judgment night and now we're done.

I pride myself on my sill to survive, i will fight to stay alive
We've got the power, destroy or create,
Terminate ourselves with our love for hate.

There's nothing I can do to make it go away.

pushing bodies in wheel barrels, bitches sterile follow on crutches of
rusted arrows try to breath through esophagus stuffed with sparrows,
the imperial, terrarembrium, the spherical, I turn the steering wheel
and pull into a 7-Eleven, met up with Billy, Danny, Rob and Evan from the
fucking Bio, yo we down for survival with acid raindrenched skin infest-
ed by termites, hermaphrodites on bikes swing spikes, think twice as I
try to pacify the pariah beside the driver and Shotgun kelly flips the
visor, time to devise a plan to reverse the demise of man before he's met
by the lastset of the sun, armageddon, no question to answer, disaster
results from behavior patterns. Earth lay raped, escape to saturn in a 
capsule, thirteen days of travel. Upon arrival plans unravel, imbalance
of chemical pheremones, clones with no genitals surround us, we can't
f*ck them, no means of reproduction. I hear a scream and turn in that
direction, 33-23-33, I see seven, coming toward us, to reward us...

Disorder, enter the millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder

[Lord Humongous]

Armageddon, a new death is dawnin', I like the smell of napalm in the
morning, four riders of the apocalypse descend from the north, a fear in
my eye, I behold a pale horse. Armageddon, no time to cry we all die as
the sky turns red, the missles start to fly. Factionstake action, eleven
families rule, millennium approaches, survival of the roaches. Body
armor will make you feel calmer or safe from the drama, deplow stealth
military bombers, ass out, get down on your knees and pray; illuminati
takes your soul on the eve of judgement day as the armies of darkness
irradicate life and we all go to hell and satan fucks your wife. Strife, ter-
ror without a minute to pray, human beings at odds, peace becomes dis-
aray, I'm humongous from Mad Max, Lord of the Wasteland with crazy ill
troops all at my command, don't you ever fall victim to my master plan,
I'm the dealer of death and here's your motherfuckin' hand.

[D-Lux]

I'm ready to take back whatever they sold ya 'cause the scheme is a secret
so nobody ever told ya, an underground illuminated tribe of radicals
ready to take forth and feast like cannibals, animals, huffing the fumes
of rotting flesh exhumed from the corpses of presisdents, dissents and
fools with a one way ticket from the temple of doom, dark sides of
moons and ill atomic booms leave the earth all shakin and full of
wounds from Krakatoa east of Java to Camaroon, and coming soon to a
theater near you, the end of everything that we once knew.

[Billy]

The grand finale strap my body with TNT, take the president and his
bitch with me tearing down the walls of this conspiracy, f*ck skull and
bones and illuminati. Irradication of the land of the free but I'm the
brave, ain't going out like a motherfuckin' slave, neobarbaric post-
apocalyptic war, ground zero brooklyn, the world at war.

[Sticky Fingaz]

I woke up, bar codes on my forehead, it's a living nightmare, my families
all dead. I gotta call Fred but no dail tone, I'm out for
self 'cause I'm gonna die alone, this is madness I'm drooling with the lock
jaw, my elevator don't go to the top floor, I hold my breath 'cause the O2
killed, I'm suffocating, I can't pay my oxygen bill. There's no tomorrow, I
wish a nigga murder me, the president declared a state of emergency.
The coast guard bangin' at my front door, I got homemade bombs if they
want war. There's no sun, they put a fucking chip in me, I'm a clone, mat-
ta fact it's a different me. I'm high tech kid, you get a bomb in the mail, so
if you die today then I'll see you in hell, I'll see you in hell, see you in hell.","God save the queen

Welcome to the rat race, people killing themselves
To get ahead of the pack, backstab and attack.
Out for self, the money, the power, the fame,
Competition and greed in a world without shame.
I stumble and fall along the path I've chosen,
I face my fears, I won't be broken.
Corrosion has a way of fucking with your sanity,
I do what I gotta to preserve my humanity.

Switchback - taking life as each day comes
Switchback - facing fears, I never run,
Switchback - never quit until I'm done
I'm the underdong and I will overcome.

Confrontation can break you down to your very fast compound.
Beat you down, drag you round, break you
Refuse to bend, never ever let it take you
Over the edge where you can never break through.
Overcome, switchback, stand strong alone
The good, the bad, the truth, the unknown
Locked up at war with the demons within
I fight to live, I live to win.

The harder that I battle with lifes deceit,
The stronger I stand on my own two feet.
If I allow the world to assimilate my mind,
Will my freedom be forever denied?
Will I no longer be free in my mind?","I am an anti-Christ

"I love you, and will always love you.
When I'm without you I feel so alone.

When I was young I didn't know you existed,
But introduced to you still as a child.
Mom and dad used to fight about you each night,
To obtain you wasn't easy for certain types.
As I grew too many friends died over you,
I didn't have you so my sex life was none.
I needed you and street life was the answer,
I found you with the use of a gun!

Money, can kill men.
Money, controls sin.
Money, can move all.
Money, is true power.

Root of all evil.

As I grew my love for you became deeper,
Addicted to you, I was sprung on your juice.
The more of you I possessed, the more power
Anything could be obtained with your use.
But the quest for you spelled pain for my victims,
'Cause for you I'd take a life without thought.
Anything in my way would be chopped down,
'Cause for me happiness would be bought!

People lie and say you really don't matter,
Singers front and say they really don't care.
If they don't want you, yo well send you to me then,
'Cause you and I are in an endless affair.","I sit and pick my brain each night
With an axe in my hand held tight
Bite my nose to spite my face

Should I hope to be vindicated

Always alone, society's abortion
Self mutilation, the daily partion
Resentful past breeds hopeful future
With tears of blood, I remove the sutures

Dying inside, emotions they hide
Irreparable damage from the tears that I've cried
I climb from the sewer, the years that I have
spent
Self mutilation or my environment

Tears of blood, tears of blood
I cry, I cry
Tears of blood, tears of blood
I die

Deny myself for fear of being
Is it over now, has my heart stopped beating
Lying here just self defeating
My mind is empty, it won't stop bleeding
Twisted anger screams my brain
Over the edge, I hang in pain
Mouth locked shut my mind won't swallow
With tears of blood alone I wallow

No one to blame except myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Maybe its just a matter of pride
Too sweet to end with suicide

Peel the scab, pour salt in the wound
Torturing myself, I'm forever doomed
Looking east and west each and every moon
A peaceful rest comes somebody soon

No one to blame expect myself
What you call masochism I call wealth

With a fuckin public defender - the public
Defender works with the fuckin D. A.!
Motherfuckers ain't got no chance, you
Ain't got no money you're fucked, you're fucked!)

Now this cell is my residence, my address is The Row.
24 hour lock down, when they'll kill me who knows?

Guilty, we the unfree!
Dead men walking
Guilty, we the unfree!
Dead men walking

I'm a genius from books now, Never read on the street.
Never lifted a fuckin' weight, now my boys concrete.
Filed a hundred appeals or more, no response from the state.
Get no phone calls or visits, My mentality's hate!

(When I was on the street I had motherfuckin' boys, where's my bitch?
She won't even accept my fuckin' phone calls! Yo, they better not let me
Up out this motherfucka , you this shit's on, f*ck that word!)

I get visits from doctors, analyzing the ill.
Families pray for my death now, vengeance lays for the kill.

(Does the defendant have any final words
He would like to say to the court?
Yeah, I got somethin' I'd like to say.
Yo, you, judge, you a racist motherfucker.
I feel like bustin your motherfuckin... no, let
Me go... I'm gonna kill everyone one of you

And blow your motherfuckin brains out. You motherfuckers!
No, keep your motherfuckin hands off! F*ck that!)

Involuntarily drugged by the state for years, now I know I'm insane.
When I'm moved shackled hands and feet, my skin's covered in ink.
I read the bible 'bout twenty-five times, now f*ck god's how I think!

(You can save all that religious bullshit,
Stay the f*ck out of my cell. If that priest
Comes in my cell, I'm a bust him in the -
I'll break your fuckin neck with my bare hands, f*ck that.)

I've been told a thousand times to give respect when due
Why do you find it so hard to believe I've got none for you
It's my heart and my mind that I'll always follow, I will not break
Nor will my balls, although that I've seen that you've tried
before
Why are people fake?

Maybe you're older, wiser on your own right, it's your mistake
I'm gonna do my own thing regardless, my choice to make
I am real, in touch with my feelings, and I know my place
You have shown, on the other hand, both sides of your face

I see the world in a different light
Things not always black and white
Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey

I would never try and tell you what was right from wrong
Maybe that's why you feel that I don't belong
Always put me down for things I've said and done
Can't you see it's a war that can't be won

A war that can't be won

Living in your world seems so clear and concise
Shutting out reality makes everything so nice
Paint a pretty picture black and white everyday
See my tattered canvass bleeding shades of grey

I see the world in a different light

Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey","You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather

But I'm a substitute for another guy

Substitute your lies for fact
I can see right through your plastic mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine looking suit is really made out of sack

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye

To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by

"Last days,
Last days.

As I stare off the stage and try to
Understand why you feel that I am
Someone you can id with, how?
When you and I come from two totally polar opposite lifestyles.
Under normal circumstances I would be
Waking you and your rich parents up at gunpoint.
Demanding the combination to the wall safe.
While your little sister screams suffering from pistol-whipped pain.
Or looking back at you in a courtroom
Filled with absolutely none of my peers.
Why are you here? Is this some voyeuristic bullshit?
See black man sing?
Or maybe, just maybe, you've been subjected to so many audio drive by's
And gang shootings that you yourself have
Become numb to the pain like me.
And you, check this out, have become
Insane from overdoses of reality.
Well stomach this, at the rate we're
Going right now white boy, yeah you, you
And I will die holding each other's throats.
That's real, the world's at war, we're at war.
Check yourself, don't be me check your goddamn self.
It's goin' down 1997, see the light, red
Lasers rip through my neighborhood at night, time is short.
Homocide is the number one sport.

Last days,
Last days,
These are the last days.

So now that all the reality's soaked, I and
You start to reanalyze every word I ever said, am I a racist?
Or am I just someone who tells it how the f*ck it is?
Well the truth of the thing is I was raised on crime.
Walking through an environment so filled with so much hate,
Honesty I do not feel that you are able to
Comprehend the magnitude of the evil.
But trip this, there were no white faces there.
Just black on black genocide.
The only white men there were the cops
That showed up late in the fourth to outline
The teenaged bodies in chalk.
So who do I hate? Do I hate you? Do I hate myself?
Or possibly am I intelligent enough to only
Hold the conditions of the ghetto itself to blame? - Not!
Who creates the conditions?
Who stops affirmative action and welfare?
Who loves the 3 strikes law?
Didn't see 'em at the Million Man March,
Or the three hundred and fifty-thousand
Man march, let your daddy tell it.
There's a lotta lies out there, what side ya on?
Armageddon is near,
I am the fourth rider of the apocalypse, recognize game.

Last days, these are the last days.
Last days, these are the last days.
Last days, these are the last days.
Last days.

(But maybe I'm all wrong, maybe everything is ok.
Maybe we're all just gonna get along.
Maybe I'm trippin', maybe life is perfect - yeah right)

I hate you, you hate me, and what does that equal?
It equals nothing, and that's exactly what we're gonna have,
Nothing, I we don't make a change soon,
And who am I to tell you anything?
I ain't nobody but a brother from South Central,
Who's had the opportunity to go around the world,
And I found out that we're all not really that different.
Racism is the number one enemy of earth.
There's only one race, the human race,
And if we don't get it together soon, this song is true.
We are all living in the last days.","Growing up I've seen a lot of shit in my time
I've seen hunger, hunger, pleasure, pain, violence and crime
I have learned from the mistakes of my friends that have died
And from those who have gone down in life that just never tried
Life is just too short I realize that now
I'm gonna get my shit together and try to make it some how
Cause one thing that I have learned is that you only live once
So now I'll take life by the balls and squeeze until they crunch

Knowledge of the streets, a valuable tool
Type of education you can't get in school
Many hard times, losing friends, getting burned
Nobody to teach me, I just learned
A man like clay molded by his surroundings
He starts to take shape of the beating and the pounding
Assembly line that I've been through
A hard motherfucker with a bad attitude
Maybe its just the times we live in
Maybe its just urban discipline

The ways of urban life are not as they seem
Standing up and fighting is what living here means
In order to survive you've got to earn your respect
The only lessons that you learn are from things that you regret

Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island and Queens
Standing up and fighting is what living here means
In order to survive you've got to earn your respect

In the chess game that the media plays

There you die, why? Find yourself a way out

Black and white and red all over

Ruling out the positive and any hope for peace
This will only kill morale, paper sales increase
This shit has got to cease

Black and white and red all over

Believe half of what you read and half what you see
Put two and two together and you'll have reality
Can't you see my reality?

Oh I want your last breath, your
Last breath, your last breath
I want your last breath

So you go downstairs to see if everything is alright
You're afraid you're alone and it's late on a rainy night
Are you asleep or awake you don't know
As you turn around,
And my rusty blade cuts you open and you hit the ground
I want your last breath
I want your last breath

[Chorus]

You're no dreamin'","Yo this is biohazard from brooklyn new york dropping some respect for almighty
Black Sabbath 1994 Motha Fuckas

Have you ever thought about your soul, can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay your grave
Is God just within your head or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a namethat you read in a book when you were at school?

When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope---Do you think he's a fool?
Well I have the truth. Yes I have seen the light and I've changed my ways.
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scaredat the end of our days.

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believed in God above
They should realize before they criticise
That God is the only way to love.

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer whemn death is near
And say they might as well worship the sun.

I think it is true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad that the opinion you had was the only one voiced.
Will you be so sure when your day is near say you won't believe?
You had a chance but you turned it down now you can't retrieve.

Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realize that he is the one,
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate.
Or will you still jeer at all you hear?
Yes---I think it's too late.

With an axe in my hand held tight
Bite my nose to spite my face
Killing myself, I can't escape the rat race
Wallowing in neck-deep misery
Quicksand dissent, pressure free
Deepest wounds are self inflicted
Should I hope to be vindicated

Always alone, society's abortion
Self mutilation, the daily partion
Resentful past breeds hopeful future
With tears of blood, I remove the sutures

Dying inside, emotions they hide
Irreparable damage from the tears that I've cried
I climb from the sewer, the years that I have
spent
Self mutilation or my environment

[Chorus: Repeat x2]
Tears of blood, tears of blood
I cry, I cry
Tears of blood, tears of blood
I die

Deny myself for fear of being
Is it over now, has my heart stopped beating
Lying here just self defeating
My mind is empty, it won't stop bleeding
Twisted anger screams my brain
Over the edge, I hang in pain
Mouth locked shut my mind won't swallow
With tears of blood alone I wallow

No one to blame except myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Maybe its just a matter of pride
Too sweet to end with suicide

Peel the scab, pour salt in the wound
Torturing myself, I'm forever doomed
Looking east and west each and every moon
A peaceful rest comes somebody soon

No one to blame expect myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Is death life and do we live in hell?

Politics which they don't understand

Stupid motherfucker, you thought you would last
Well took the wrong path, now your name is in the past

Another fuckin' lowlife connected to the first
A crooked cop on the take, nothing could be worse
Twenty one gun salute, the widow lays the wreath
The whole police department covered up he was a thief

Never tought the day would come, bang, a fuckin' hit

Money isn't everything, I guess it was to you
Did you control your own life or greed controlled you
For the lives that you destroyed, so morally depraved
For the people you left grieving, I spit on your grave

Obey and follow strict laws to the letter
Do as you're told and life will be better
Go with the flow, avoid the strife, let unknown powers rule your life
A box of glass dictates your death, stolen minds, innocence last breath

Whatever happened to the good old days, no mental smokescreen, subliminal haze?
Corporate society prints out your thoughts Spirituality sold and bought
Now your life is all dictated, all you stood for, all you hated
Establishment prevails again, on your knees before the mighty them

On your knees pray to the one you appease

Look in my eyes and you will find
Another way to get through your life
Stare at my face, make up your mind
And you will find love at first sight
Connect your soul now get online
Mind control taking your life
Connect your soul now get online
Mind control

Try not to look 'cause you might turn to stone 
How much time do you really think on your own?
Just trying to be yourself, don't want to be like no one else
It was something that was once pure, and the truth was meant to endure
Gotta find out who's to blame, gotta end this mind control game

On your knees pray to the one you appease

Look in my eyes and you will find
Another way to get through your life
Stare at my face, make up your mind
And you will find love at first sight

You're using all the tricks that you used on me,
You're reading all them high-fashion magazines,

Revenge

Drive-by","The dirt's so thick it won't come clean
All around a haze like a smoke screen
I can't see you but you see me
But I might be gone before you count to three

The waters are totally polluted
The armies inside my head have feuded
One side has smothered the other
The disease it spreads and begins to cover

Maggot infested soul of mine
Has painted me in a corner confined
My vision is blurred no reason or rhyme
Help me escape these walls I climb

I'm drowning in my own shit, gasping
Gagging on the vomit, asphyxiated, grasping
For a grip on the soap with the rope
So I can get clean and begin to cope

Scrub me 'til I'm raw, an open sore oozing
Unless I'm clean I might start losing
My mind and my life would have a fucked-up ending
Thank God if you ever see cleansing

Maggot infested soul of mine
Has painted me in a corner confined
My vision is blurred no reason or rhyme
Help me escape these walls I climb

Sewn my eyes shut, can't you see I'm smothered?
Deaf, dumb and blind, the dirt has covered
The windows which let the light shine through
Cleansing of the soul, for I am you

The last time I slept I dreamt
My friend and I we got so high
On top of mountains, deep in the sky
Way up high where the white goes by

The air is thin and hard to breathe
But with a friend near, by your side 
you can conquer the world or wander around all starry-eyed
I laid there and dreamt, along for a ride

I took in the journey, my friend beside
It all seemed so real, it all seemed surreal
my friend and I were one deep inside

These dreams come and go and are never the same
I await new journeys asleep I remain
When I hold my eyes shut tight I dream
When I dream at night through my dreams I scream

Why do people fucking go and have to change?
What pushed my friend to tap the vein?
Asleep at night I visit my friend
Asleep at night I miss my friend

The dirt's so thick it won't come clean
All around a haze like a smoke screen
I can't see you but you see me

I wonder why my momma always cried
Was it for how fast we lived and died?
Or because we never got our piece of the pie?

Like Meth said Cream, Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Parents with good intentions never mention
The Brooklyn House of Detention

Free to fly, and free to try, to get our piece of the pie and die

Locking us down, we got cops all around
The sound of sirens drown your own heart's pound
But you only wanted a piece of the pie
And in your mind's eye momma's still gonna cry

No matter how hard you tried, whether it's truth or lies
On the day that you die, but we're free to fly
And free to try to get our piece of the pie and die

But my reflex is to try to break out

But my feet stay on the ground, that's how I've grown

Transfused at birth by my urban surroundings

Gravity won't allow me to fly
It pulls me down, the pain, I won't cry
Resistance and drive fueled by hunger
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

I just can't let shit get to me
Got to reflect back on what pop taught me
To be your own man no matter what
To never back down, and follow your gut
Instinct, something he said that I'd know
Something that I'd carry wherever I go
He told me someday I'd have to fight to be free
And resist the weight of gravity

Gravity won't allow me to fly
It pulls me down, the pain, I won't cry
Resistance and drive fueled by hunger
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

Calloused hands wipe away tears
Of the pain of a man broken by years
A silent shot that nobody hears
A smoking gun of our own fears
My father worked all his life and for what?
Day in, day out, caught in a rut
The pain of apathy, razor-sharp cutting
But I'll make sure he doesn't die for nothing

Gravity won't allow me to fly
It pulls me down, the pain, I won't cry
Resistance and drive fueled by hunger
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger","God save the queen

The world's insane
While you drink champagne
And I'm livin' in black rain,
Don't you hear the guns
You stupid, dumb, dick suckin', bum politicians.

Tell us what to do... f*ck you!
Tell us what to do... f*ck you!
The tension mounts...","The sun is shining, but I don't know if it'll shine again
The sky is clear now, but the clouds wait overhead
The wind stopped blowing, but I see the trees are flowing
The water's calm now, feel the undertow towing me down
Towing me down

The sun's gone down now, behind the dark clouds looming
Birds stop singing, silence so soothing
Dark clouds open up, I hold my rain-soaked head
Thoughts are racing by, I scream and wish that I was dead
I wish that I was dead

Gotta find a way in this world to cope
Gotta find a place in this world with hope

Gotta find a way to keep my head straight another day
I pray to let go of hate, I break myself away from my mind
I search for inner peace, I never find","An imitation from New York

Burning high and higher, pressure starts to climb
Turning passion into sweat, Jekyll into Hyde
Glossy eyed, unsatisfied, I can't help but deny

As my love gets set aside
As my love gets set aside
Magnified by hate inside

Face down upon the ground
Looking down at her, you start to frown
Thinking to yourself, ""Am I insane to do the things I do to her in vain?""

Woman beater with your hands wrapped around her neck
Deranged, demented, a psycho-social wreck
Your self-denial, hatred, got to keep it in check
You rape for love and you kill for respect

I find myself all alone
The pain will wash away
Unless she is taught, she has been shown
It's got to be my way

And now she is gone
The blood is on my hands
No remorse, what have I done?
And act of God or man?

"Aw yeah, what's up out there? BC's in the house. Right
About now, I want to tell you a little love story, you know
What I'm sayin', this is a Body Count love story check out
The lyrics, you know, I'm a tell you 'bout what happened
When we went down South last year on tour.

Out on tour yo, I been all around the world
Went to Georgia, met this fine-assed white girl,
Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits and thighs,
The kinda girl that would knock out most guys.
She got wild in the backstage bathroom,
Sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum,
Said ""I love you, but my daddy don't play,
He's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK.""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

You know what I'm sayin'. So we was down South fallin' in
Love, you know, D-Roc had this Nazi girl, my man
Mooseman had a skinhead, I fell in love with Tipper Gore's
Two twelve year old nieces. It was wild, you know what I'm
Sayin', it got even worse, you know.

So one night they took us to a meetin'
White sheets, white hoods, no room for seatin'
There was Skinheads, Nazi's and crazies,
Talkin' 'bout black people pushin' up daisies.
They hated Blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans,
Mexicans, Chinese, even the Indians.
We had our hoods on,
We were slick
She pushed her butt up hard against my dick.
Then her daddy jumped on the stage
Talkin' 'bout killin' in a goddamn rage.
I got mad, my dick got hard
Entered in her ass
She said, ""Oh my God!""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves
Everybody. We love Mexican girls, Black girls, Oriental girls,
It really don't matter. If you from Mars, and you got a pussy,
We will f*ck you. You know, that's all we're sayin', word.

So every year when Body Count comes around
We throw an orgy in every little Southern town.
KKK's, Skinheads, and Nazi
Girls break their necks
To get to the party.
It ain't like their men can't nut,
Their dick's too little
And they just can't f*ck.
So we get buck wild with the white freaks
We show them how to really work the white sheets.
I know her daddy'll really be after me,
When his grandson's named little Ice-T.

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.","Beaten senseless in everyway
Life disappears, get's blown away
New world chaos in disarray
A second to die and forever to pray
The time has come to push to fight, to die, to live
This time I take the fall
Don't sort them out just kill them all
Just never push my back against the wall
Beaten senseless, violent relentless
No hope defenseless, beaten senseless
Now you pushed me over the edge
Can't take it no more, I'm seeing red
Beaten senseless over the head
Never gonna stop until your all fucking dead
Vengeance is my only thought
Rage, abuse, the wars I've fought
Self preservation is self taught
Turn your back and you'll be caught
Crushing pain intensity a violent beating senselessly so cruel, agony
Broken spirit, broken home,
A broken man who can not cope with pain, misery
","What you see, you can get
Nothing's free, nothing's said
Don't be fooled by the signs
Don't read in between the lines

What you're gonna say
What you're gonna do
Now you've missed out once again
But I thought you knew

Oh, you silly thing
You've really gone and done it now
Oh, you silly thing
You really gone and done it now

Trouble here, trouble there
People stop just to stare
What's the use of wasting time
Just move on, leave 'em all behind

What you're gonna say
What you're gonna do
Now you've missed out once again
But I thought you knew

Oh, you silly thing
You've really gone and done it now

On someone you call a friend
When you see the naked eyes
You don't even ask 'em why
You don't even ask 'em why

Fast fuse burning the lessons I've been taught
It's just too late to remember who I am
The things that I believe in and the way that I stand
About peace, harmony, respect for fellow man
All that shit just got thrown against the fan
In my violent rage, they say that I am a criminal
There ain't no labels within the human animal
In this world of bigotry and pain
The violence spreads and terror reigns
The opinions in our minds replace our souls
As the human animal takes control
The path of self-destruction has brought me to this point
As modern day society cracks arthritic joints
No mercy is shown, it's hitting all my weak spots
I never had a gun, but now I want to hear gun shots
I sleep not for fear, I get no rest
Twisted in a sense, 'cause my button has been pressed
How many ways have you shown me that you hate me
And then you wonder why what have you done to me lately
I am an animal
The human animal
A human animal
Tension building, I'm being pushed too far
I need a release, take the lid of this jar
My voice seems useless in this situation
Time to take action, release frustration
Everyone has limits, only so much you can take
Antagonizing pressure is the icing on the cake
Physical abuse, induced or subliminal
Open the door, unleash the human animal
Flashes of red my vision of distortion
Like a virus, it spreads, giving each his portion
Contagious psychopath, the vibe is in synch
Movin' like a pack, we're back to basic instincts
Wild at heart, now we show our true colors
In the path of desperation, we forget about our brothers
Who would die for us, now, we die for no man
Deranged from the instance, violence came too hard
Instinctual behavior in the given situation
Leaves us with no call for rationalization","An imitation from New York

He took the money to the dope man
And he said he had the best
Next thing ya knew, cardiac arrest!
It was a rollercoaster, he couldn't get off
Next thing I knew my friends' life was lost. Noooooooooo

You wanna get high as the sky
You're kissin' your life goodbye

But the winners lose it all someday.","I question not me, it only happens to others
I can't deny reality as life gets smothered

If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
Cause he who paints the big picture runs the whole scene

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous? Am I better off dead?

Punishment, for all my sins

A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind

Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate? On the corner rolling dice
Punishment, but I've done nothing wrong
In my eyes, who really pays the price

My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done
Sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got
Though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar, as I kneel down and I
Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of
the truth, whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right
off the roof, 'cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
but now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact that the majority
of the people are out there smoking crack, getting doped up,
shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a
question we all ask and must answer before long, 'cause no one
is safe in this world, what's the deal, the sentence is death and to
what court do I appeal?

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

Punishment","Don't you give me no lip child

Have you ever thought about your soul, can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay your grave
Is God just within your head or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a namethat you read in a book when you were at school?

When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope---Do you think he's a fool?
Well I have the truth. Yes I have seen the light and I've changed my ways.
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scaredat the end of our days.

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believed in God above
They should realize before they criticise
That God is the only way to love.

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer whemn death is near
And say they might as well worship the sun.

I think it is true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad that the opinion you had was the only one voiced.
Will you be so sure when your day is near say you won't believe?
You had a chance but you turned it down now you can't retrieve.

Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realize that he is the one,
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate.

"No, no, no, Momma

All my life I loved this girl so much,
All my life I loved her simple touch.
She cared for me and put me on this earth,
Oh the pain of just a simple birth.
But now I find that she has left me dumb and blind,
Poisoned, twisted, and destroyed my mind.
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race
That's why I hate you!
There's only one way I can make it right,
Momma's gotta die tonight.
There's only one way I can make it right,
Momma's gotta die tonight.

Momma, momma, I always loved my momma,
I always loved my momma.
I loved the way she hold me,
I love the way she talked to me.
She used to teach me a lot of things,
She taught me good things, she taught me bad things.
""Don't trust white people, don't trust white people.
Don't trust white people, they're no good, they're no good,
They're no good, they're no good.
They're just gonna rip you off, they're just gonna rip you off.
Don't trust 'em, don't trust 'em.""
I said, ""Why momma?"", she said, ""I told you don't
Trust 'em they're no good.""
I said, ""Momma, I thought we were all the same momma,
Why momma?"" She said, ""Don't ask me any questions.
Don't you challenge your mutha."" Momma.

So one day I found I fell in love
And I brought my girlfriend home
And I introduced her to my mutha and
She smacked me, was a white girl and
I said, ""Why momma? Why momma? What did I do wrong?""
You know, I found out my mutha was a evil woman.
She hated Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Jamaicans,
Indians, Orientals, momma was no good.
I learned to hate my mutha, hate my mutha.
So I got some, ha ha, some lighter fluid, from the corner store
And I put it around her bed, and I set her on fire!
Ha, ha, ha.
Burn momma, burn momma, burn momma, burn bitch
Burn, burn, burrrrrn. Ha, ha, ha. Burn you racist bitch!
Ha, ha, ha.
But she wasn't quite dead. She jumped up from the bed
And I grabbed my Louisville Slugger that she had bought
Me for my twelfth birthday and I came up behind her and
I hit her, I hit her, I hit her twice. Ha, ha, ha.
Now she was out.
I went into the kitchen
And I got that handy carving knife
That we only use on special occasions like
Bullshit Thanksgiving, and I took her and I laid her ol'
Fucked up corpse on the floor and I cut her in
Little bitty pieces. Cut off her arms, her feet,
Her neck, and I put her into little green hefty bags
And I put it into my car and I said, ""Momma, we're goin' on
A vacation, a permanent vacation bitch.""
I took some of her around the world to Arizona, New York,
Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Oakland. Ha, ha, ha, yo, you
Want to go to Connecticut, bitch. Ohio, Detroit, Texas, L.A.
Whose laughin' now momma, whose laughin' now bitch,
Whose laughin' now.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

So if you got a mutha or a grandmutha or a father
Who wants to carry on the same racist bullshit that's
Fucked this world up from day one,
You can either look 'em in the face and tell 'em to
Suck your dick or do like Body Count does.

All my life I loved her simple touch.

"Yo Moose, stop the car right here.
Alright, give it here, give it here.
No man let me do it, cool ice.
Stay in the car man, stay in the car. Stay in the car.

Uh, hi officers, um, we had a flat tire back there.
Do you think you guys could help us out?
""Naw, that's not my job. My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out.""
I mean, um, you know I don't have any other way to get home.
""That's not my job, asshole.""
Well uh, could you tell me what your job is?
""Right now my job is eatin' these doughnuts, or maybe...
hey, wait a minute. Aren't you...""

Yup.","Here's a dedication
To the men and women who've served in Vietnam
From our generation to you and your family...
Respect is long overdue
Memories of blood, red, white, blue
Orange skies at night, southeast Asia knew
You were called to serve and you did it well
For us you've made a round-trip through hell
Wars within wars, within wars
To survive you made your own laws
Every day and night to stay alive
You kept your head down and your powder dry
Memories of families
It's God i've known
Take me home
Now you live asking God why
He didn't take you when your brothers all died
Explosions shake the dreams in your head at night in bed
Don't wake him up or you'll end up dead
Try to understand his pain
He still sees blood stains that remain
In his heart and mind, try to numb the pain
People think they understand
Sat watching TV back on quiet land
They spit on you now we'll spit back for you
Our hearts, our voice, gift of our hands
What can they do for you and those who served
And died, we pay respect to the families
Who still cry
Your kids are now full grown
With the love and pride you should have known
Back when your country brought you home
Still now you fight the tears and face your fears each day
But the horrors of fact won't go away
For 2300 MIA's or POW's to this day
We remember and pray for you","You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather

But I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, yeah

Substitute your lies for fact
I can see right through your plastic mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine looking suit is really made out of sack

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by

Substitute me for him
Substitute my coke for gin
Substitute you for my mum
At least I'll get my washing done

Five blocks to the subway, just five blocks away
Five blocks to the subway, I can do that any day
There's a local wise guy he owns the whole damn block

Are we alone or do we have friends
Or are we just searchin' for a means to an end

But as soon as we leave they talk behind our backs
Low selfimage of the way things are
Either way we lose and we can never go far
'Cause always we'll wonder as to just what's the deal
It just depends on what you feel is real
Perception is everything inside our brains
With much bigger problems, no time for games
Of people acting down but it's just a facade
Can't say it to my face, isn't that odd
Just what exactly does trust mean
Is it about being down with the scene
Or is it about following your own true heart
And being true to your friends to the end from the start
Just what is wealth it's just how you view it
It's not having to wonder whether or not you might lose it
It can't be about material gain
If you're drowning alone neck deep in pain
To trust and lay your soul on the line
May not be the nature of most humankind
Lookin' over your shoulder is no way to go

Wild at heart, now we show our true colors

"Aw yeah, what's up out there? BC's in the house. Right
About now, I want to tell you a little love story, you know
What I'm sayin', this is a Body Count love story check out
The lyrics, you know, I'm a tell you 'bout what happened
When we went down South last year on tour.

Out on tour yo, I been all around the world
Went to Georgia, met this fine-assed white girl,
Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits and thighs,
The kinda girl that would knock out most guys.
She got wild in the backstage bathroom,
Sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum,
Said ""I love you, but my daddy don't play,
He's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK.""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

You know what I'm sayin'. So we was down South fallin' in
Love, you know, D-Roc had this Nazi girl, my man
Mooseman had a skinhead, I fell in love with Tipper Gore's
Two twelve year old nieces. It was wild, you know what I'm
Sayin', it got even worse, you know.

So one night they took us to a meetin'
White sheets, white hoods, no room for seatin'
There was Skinheads, Nazi's and crazies,
Talkin' 'bout black people pushin' up daisies.
They hated Blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans,
Mexicans, Chinese, even the Indians.
We had our hoods on,
We were slick
She pushed her butt up hard against my dick.
Then her daddy jumped on the stage
Talkin' 'bout killin' in a goddamn rage.
I got mad, my dick got hard
Entered in her ass
She said, ""Oh my God!""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves
Everybody. We love Mexican girls, Black girls, Oriental girls,
It really don't matter. If you from Mars, and you got a pussy,
We will f*ck you. You know, that's all we're sayin', word.

So every year when Body Count comes around
We throw an orgy in every little Southern town.
KKK's, Skinheads, and Nazi
Girls break their necks
To get to the party.
It ain't like their men can't nut,
Their dick's too little
And they just can't f*ck.
So we get buck wild with the white freaks
We show them how to really work the white sheets.
I know her daddy'll really be after me,
When his grandson's named little Ice-T.

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.","Sometimes I feel it's a waste of time
To listen to your shouting a wordless pantomime
Can't you see it falls on deaf ears
Filling me up with your point of view
Your opinions are your own, I got mine too

When the shit hits the fan
And you're forced by the man
Who holds the key to our promised land
Don't misunderstand what's in the man's hand
'Cause it's all been laid out in the New World Plan
Makin' me feel like a laboratory rat
Without a mind of its own - diseased and fat
I can't let my life go out like that
'Cause I'm an extra skeptic, a true eclectic
I find it hard to trust all the people we've elected
Take a look around, do you feel protected
Like garbage in a dump our lives have been rejected
A blind man leading the not so blind
Creating false truth to fill our minds
To listen to yourself would be a crime
It all comes back to you some time
Like it or not, they got a number on me
I will not break for your demands
Rabid, defensive, in the corner I stand
Caught in a trap, the bait was free
Like it or not, they got a number on me
I can't trust anyone, they're all out to get me
Gonna run until I can't run from the laws that ruin me
Faster and harder so God help me flee
From the lies that we're free and the powers that be
That push the rich forward between you and me
But agree to agree with no guarantee
Of something to live for I'll die if need be
I stand up for all as I fight to be free","I'll only ask you once more

Samuel Beckett, Eugene O'Neill, Edna O'Brien and Lawrence Stern

I'll only ask you once more

She had an old doll,
She had a long shiny needle (Voodoo)

She held the doll in the air (Voodoo)
She took the scissors,
Cut off all its fingers!
Ah!
My fingers, bitch!

Ah!

So if you're ever down in New Orleans, yeah.
You might meet an old lady
She might have a doll
It might look like you.

"On Oprah today, we discuss male promiscuity.
Why men are constantly in the search for sex,
and new sexual partners.","I question not me, it only happens to others
I can't deny reality as life gets smothered

If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
Cause he who paints the big picture runs the whole scene

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous? Am I better off dead?

Punishment, for all my sins

A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind

Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate? On the corner rolling dice
Punishment, but I've done nothing wrong
In my eyes, who really pays the price

My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done
Sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got
Though not much it seems a lot

Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of
the truth, whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right
off the roof, 'cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
but now I'm positive and life it all ends

of the people are out there smoking crack, getting doped up,
shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a
question we all ask and must answer before long, 'cause no one
is safe in this world, what's the deal, the sentence is death and to
what court do I appeal?

"No, no, no, Momma

All my life I loved this girl so much,
All my life I loved her simple touch.
She cared for me and put me on this earth,
Oh the pain of just a simple birth.
But now I find that she has left me dumb and blind,
Poisoned, twisted, and destroyed my mind.
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race
That's why I hate you!
There's only one way I can make it right,
Momma's gotta die tonight.
There's only one way I can make it right,
Momma's gotta die tonight.

Momma, momma, I always loved my momma,
I always loved my momma.
I loved the way she hold me,
I love the way she talked to me.
She used to teach me a lot of things,
She taught me good things, she taught me bad things.
""Don't trust white people, don't trust white people.
Don't trust white people, they're no good, they're no good,
They're no good, they're no good.
They're just gonna rip you off, they're just gonna rip you off.
Don't trust 'em, don't trust 'em.""
I said, ""Why momma?"", she said, ""I told you don't
Trust 'em they're no good.""
I said, ""Momma, I thought we were all the same momma,
Why momma?"" She said, ""Don't ask me any questions.
Don't you challenge your mutha."" Momma.

So one day I found I fell in love
And I brought my girlfriend home
And I introduced her to my mutha and
She smacked me, was a white girl and
I said, ""Why momma? Why momma? What did I do wrong?""
You know, I found out my mutha was a evil woman.
She hated Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Jamaicans,
Indians, Orientals, momma was no good.
I learned to hate my mutha, hate my mutha.
So I got some, ha ha, some lighter fluid, from the corner store
And I put it around her bed, and I set her on fire!
Ha, ha, ha.
Burn momma, burn momma, burn momma, burn bitch
Burn, burn, burrrrrn. Ha, ha, ha. Burn you racist bitch!
Ha, ha, ha.
But she wasn't quite dead. She jumped up from the bed
And I grabbed my Louisville Slugger that she had bought
Me for my twelfth birthday and I came up behind her and
I hit her, I hit her, I hit her twice. Ha, ha, ha.
Now she was out.
I went into the kitchen
And I got that handy carving knife
That we only use on special occasions like
Bullshit Thanksgiving, and I took her and I laid her ol'
Fucked up corpse on the floor and I cut her in
Little bitty pieces. Cut off her arms, her feet,
Her neck, and I put her into little green hefty bags
And I put it into my car and I said, ""Momma, we're goin' on
A vacation, a permanent vacation bitch.""
I took some of her around the world to Arizona, New York,
Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Oakland. Ha, ha, ha, yo, you
Want to go to Connecticut, bitch. Ohio, Detroit, Texas, L.A.
Whose laughin' now momma, whose laughin' now bitch,
Whose laughin' now.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

So if you got a mutha or a grandmutha or a father
Who wants to carry on the same racist bullshit that's
Fucked this world up from day one,
You can either look 'em in the face and tell 'em to
Suck your dick or do like Body Count does.

All my life I loved this girl so much,
All my life I loved her simple touch.
She cared for me and put me on this earth
Oh the pain of just a simple birth.
Right now I find that she has left me dumb and blind
Poisoned, twisted, and destroyed my mind.
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race

Listen up, I'll give you a for instance

Won't they learn they'll never win
Play not the hands of the media vultures
We must learn to unite our cultures
Violence constantly tears us apart
Show the world that we've got heart

[Chorus:]

Blood is spilled on black and white
Different colors, why do we fight
Face the facts, stone cold sober
Black and white and red all over

Someone rapes and stabs their mother
I think it'ssick to count the death toll
On and on the media rolls
Drive by shootings, homicide
Nobody cares about the mother who cried
A family's grief stepped on by ratings
Understand why I keep hating

It makes no sense for us to be pawns
In the chess game that the media plays

If the streets are where you run
There you die, why? Find yourself a way out

Black and white and red all over

Ruling out the positive and any hope for peace
This will only kill morale, paper sales increase
This shit has got to cease

Black and white and red all over

Believe half of what you read and half what you see
Put two and two together and you'll have reality
Can't you see my reality?

Rape, arsan, robberies

The L.A.P.D.
For every cop that has ever taken advantage of somebody,
beat 'em down or hurt 'em,
because they have long hair,
listen to the wrong kind of music,
wrong color,
 
whatever they thought was the reason to do it,
For every one of those fuckin' police,
I'd like to take a pig out here in this parkin' lot,
and shoot 'em in their muthafuckin' face.","A man with a promise smashes down my door
He sees a future with me, he's gonna give me more
""Give me all your trust, I'msure you won't regret
Just sign the dotted line, and I'll do so the rest""
He says I can't make it alone, not without him
But I've always been on my own, he doesn't know who I am
And now I'm starting to see just what you are to me
A parasitic leech of my life

[Pre-chorus:]

You feed off the art that I bleed
You're a man with a promise but you ain't shit to me

A man broke his promise and he wants reparations
He sold me up the river, cause me grief and frustration
I gave him all my trust and got stabbed in the back
A lucky motherfucker that he hasn't yet been whacked
You ain't no fucking artist, spend your life exploiting others
Try all you want, you can't break me or my brothers
A business man vulture,no honor, no class
Take your money and your lawyers and shove 'em up your ass

[Pre-chorus II:]

You feed off the art that I bleed
Numbers to you is just pain to me

[Chorus:]

Now the tables are turned
Can't you see motherfucker that you've been burned
You're a man with a promise but you ain't shit to me
You ain't shit to me

[Chorus]","I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone,

You're using all the tricks that you used on me,
You're reading all them high-fashion magazines,
The clothes you're wearing, girl, they're causing public scenes.

But, now you're walking around like you're front page news,
You've been awful careful 'bout the friends you choose,
But, you won't find my name in your book of ""Who's Who"".

From the things that are bathering me
It's been too long since I felt this way
From your sad life I broke free
Don't ever think that you ripped me apart
And walked away with a price
Cause you can not penetrate my cold heart
ANd fill it with your disease

I wonder now how I lived before
Deaf, dumb, dead and blind
I moved my life forward and I'm never goin' back
And I've left you far behind
There's a lot of things that I've now realized
From the way that you treated me
It's bullshit and it's hatred you epitomized
You were blessed to have been with me

[Chorus:]

You filled my life with your disease
I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees
Disease is flowing through my veins
I'd rather die right now than live in pain

Looking around at the past and the present
Things are so much better now
Your misery wanted my company
But you can't keep a good man down
Whatever made me want to be with you
Is something I can't understand
'cause if I never saw your fucking face again
I'd die a happy man

[Chorus 2x]","Gentle pretty thing
Who only had one spring
You bravely faced the world
Ready for anything
I'm happy that you lived
For your life is mine
What have I except to cry

The crime of the century
Who shot little Bambi

"1994 BC still in the house They did
Everything they could do to take us out
But like any good monster that just made us stronger
You see, they don't like us and they don't like you,
The BC fan,
'Cause they know we stand for three things
Truth, justice and f*ck the American way
That word justice got me fucked up though
Twenty cops in the street, two go to jail
Thousands of people died in wars
Overseas and it's justice ?
You think they give a f*ck about us ?
You're a fool

Born yellow,
Born brown,
Born red,
Born black,
Born dead
Dead
Born dead

Born Asian,
Born Jewish,
Born Latino,
Born poor,
Born dead
Dead

But you don't hear me though

Dead
New York , Atlanta, Chicago, Oakland, Miami, Detroit

Every day I gotta get out my muthafuckin' bed,
Put on my muthafuckin' gun,
Down in my muthafuckin' gun,
Down in my muthafuckin' pants, 'cause
Muthafucka's out here is trippin'

How the f*ck you gonna get up every morning
Tryin' to worry about if you gonna make it to the next evening
Do you understand ?
Sometimes we take for granted
The little things like food, like freedom

Born in Somalia,
Born in south America,
Born in south Africa,
Born in south central,
Born dead
Dead

Born dead","Growing up I've seen a lot of shit in my time
I've seen hunger, hunger, pleasure, pain, violence and crime
I have learned from the mistakes of my friends that have died
And from those who have gone down in life that just never tried
Life is just too short I realize that now
I'm gonna get my shit together and try to make it some how
Cause one thing that I have learned is that you only live once
So now I'll take life by the balls and squeeze until they crunch

Knowledge of the streets, a valuable tool
Type of education you can't get in school
Many hard times, losing friends, getting burned
Nobody to teach me, I just learned
A man like clay molded by his surroundings
He starts to take shape of the beating and the pounding
Assembly line that I've been through
A hard motherfucker with a bad attitude
Maybe its just the times we live in
Maybe its just urban discipline

The ways of urban life are not as they seem
Standing up and fighting is what living here means
In order to survive you've got to earn your respect
The only lessons that you learn are from things that you regret

Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island and Queens
Standing up and fighting is what living here means
In order to survive you've got to earn your respect
The only lessons that you learn are from things that you regret","Look at that
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
One of the cutest since I don't know when
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with all the guys from outta my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
She's sure fine lookin', man, she's something else

Look at that
'Cross the street
There's a car built just for me
To own a car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
That car's fine lookin', man, it's something else

Hey, look at that
Just wait and see
Worked hard and saved my dough
I buy that car and then I roll up with joe
Get me that girl and we go ridin' around
We look real sharp with the wide top down
I keep on dreamin' and thinkin' to myself
When it all comes true, man, that's something else

Hey, look at that
What's all this? 
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I'm a-knockin' on her door
My car's out front and it's all mine
It's a '41 job not a '59
I got that girl and I'm thinkin' to myself
She's sure fine lookin', man, she's something else"

If today was gonna be his last
An average day in the middle of a life
Terminated by a sharp knife
Killing, spilling the liquid blood
As his boyz found him lying face down in the mud
You might say this song is in poor taste
But I must discuss the waste

[Chorus I:]

Of lives of friends that I have lost
Who pays the price, who pays the cost
Can't cry, just anger till the end
It burns inside to lose a friend

Walking thin lines, anything to cop a dime
Labelled habitual, a loser three times
Just fucking' around, knuckles bloody to the bone
Whatever, the future's unknown
Unless you believe in predestination of fate
The letter read termination
It was fucked up I couldn't make out his face
Through the blod, what a fucking waste

[Chorus I]

[Chorus II:]

My friend was there until the end (my friend)
Can never be replaced
The pain that I taste (It's over)
What a fucking waste

[Chorus I]

Cold blooded murder, suicide, another body laid to rest
Untimely demise, homicide, my faith is put to the test
Is there a god, sometimes I just can't believe
My friend who is dead was shot and then robbed
Something quite hard to conceive
People dying everyday there's got to be a better way
The losses blow my mind away, the stain of blood will always stay
Like the memory of a friend who stood with me until the end
The losses blow my mind away, the stain of blood will always stay

[Chorus I]

[Lead]

It's not for me that I grieve, but for the families left berieved
I question whether life is fair, I wonder if I even care
We think we know what life is worth until they lower us beneath
the earth
Mother crying, forever hurt, my face like stone I shavel dirt

[Chorus II]","Belsen was a gas I heard the other day
In the open graves where the jews all lay
Life is fun and I wish you were here
They wrote on postcards to those held dear

Oh dear
Sergeant majors on the march
Wash their bodies in the starch
See them all die one by one
Guess it's dead, guess it's glad

So bad
Belsen was a gas I heard the other day
In the open graves where the jews all lay
Life is fun and I wish you were here
They wrote on postcards to those held dear

Oh dear

Be a man
Belsen was a gas
Be a man, kill someone, kill yourself 
Be a man, be someone, kill someone
Be a man, kill yourself"

"Every day we lose somebody close to us

Don’t tell me that you love me
Don’t tell me that you need me
Don’t wait to tell me that you love me

When I’m gone
This is our life
When I’m gone
This is our time

Don’t wait ‘til I’m dead until these words are said
Don’t wait until I die and then start to fake cry
Tell the people that you love that you love ‘em now
Show the people you appreciate just how
How much they mean to ya
How much you care how real it is
They’re right in front of ya
Your family
Your wife
Your kids
Don’t wait for tragedy to tell ‘em how you really feel
Don’t wait
Tomorrow might be too fuckin’ late

Don’t wait to tell me that you miss me
When I’m gone
This is our time
Don’t wait to tell me that you love me 
When I’m gone
This is our life
Don’t wait to tell me that you need me
When I’m gone
This is our life
Don’t wait to tell me that you need me
When I’m gone

I’ll be lost without you
How do I make it right
How do I take back all the time I’ve wasted alone
How would it make you feel
How would it make you feel
Knowing you had the chance and let it slip away

Don’t wait until I’m dead

Tell ‘em that you care
You’ve got family
Tell ‘em how you feel

Seems like yesterday my man was sittin’ next to me

I don’t do funerals
Don’t wanna see you in no box
I miss my homies and my love for them will never stop
Don’t have regret and wait until your loved one dies

Don’t wait to tell me that you love me

With an axe in my hand held tight
Bite my nose to spite my face
Killing myself, I can't escape the rat race
Wallowing in neck-deep misery
Quicksand dissent, pressure free
Deepest wounds are self inflicted
Should I hope to be vindicated

Always alone, society's abortion
Self mutilation, the daily partion
Resentful past breeds hopeful future
With tears of blood, I remove the sutures

Dying inside, emotions they hide
Irreparable damage from the tears that I've cried
I climb from the sewer, the years that I have
spent
Self mutilation or my environment

[Chorus: Repeat x2]
Tears of blood, tears of blood
I cry, I cry
Tears of blood, tears of blood
I die

Deny myself for fear of being
Is it over now, has my heart stopped beating
Lying here just self defeating
My mind is empty, it won't stop bleeding
Twisted anger screams my brain
Over the edge, I hang in pain
Mouth locked shut my mind won't swallow
With tears of blood alone I wallow

No one to blame except myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Maybe its just a matter of pride
Too sweet to end with suicide

Peel the scab, pour salt in the wound
Torturing myself, I'm forever doomed
Looking east and west each and every moon
A peaceful rest comes somebody soon

No one to blame expect myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Is death life and do we live in hell?

Without giving us the loot

That's what you get for
Living like this
With a bullet in your head, you're dead, you can't miss
Ain't no time for regret when you're body is in a bag
Ain't no time to change your mind when your head begins to sag
Should've known better, ain't working for you now
Maybe if you'd know better you'd be here somehow
So change your ways before you ways change you
With a hole in your head that you can see through
You're looking up and you're looking down
Shot's are rippin' out from all around
You're crying out for help but it can't be found
The voice of regret is the only sound
You play the game and you pay the price
For hustlin' in the gutter with the motherfuckin' street lice
You're runnin' and gunnin' and whatever else goes
And you're goin' with your crew whichever way the wind blows
""Cause you got their back and they got yours
And you live for yourself and you make your own laws
But sooner or later what goes around comes around
You wind up dead and buried in hard, cold ground","There's unlimited supply
And there is no reason why
I tell you it was all a frame
They only did it 'cause of fame
Who?

E.M.I. E.M.I. E.M.I.

Too many people had the suss
Too many people support us
An unlimited amount
Too many outlets in and out
Who?

E.M.I. E.M.I. E.M.I.

And sir and friends are crucified
A day they wished that we had died
We are an addition we are ruled by none
Never ever never

And you thought that we were faking
That we were all just money making
You do not believe we're for real
Or you would lose your cheap appeal?

Don't judge a book just by the cover
Unless you cover just another
And blind acceptance is a sign
A stupid fools who stand in line
Like

E.M.I. E.M.I. E.M.I.

Unlimited edition
With an unlimited supply
That was the only reason
We all had to say goodbye

Unlimited supply E.M.I
There is no reason why E.M.I.

"I didn't fall to negativity

I can't deny reality as lite gets smothered

If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
'Cause he who paints the big picture
Runs the whole scene

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous, am I better off dead?

Punishment for all my sins

A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind

Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate on the corner rolling dice
Punishment but I've done nothing wrong in my eyes
Who really pays the fucking price

My lament for the human race
Guilty punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done, sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar
As I kneel down and I confess to the Father
That I'm suffering a burning question of the truth
Whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right off the roof
'Cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
But now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact
That the majority of the people are out there smoking crack
Getting doped up, shooting that shit into their veins
The question must be asked if we have any brains left

Or right or wrong in this song
A question we all ask and must answer before long
'Cause no one is safe in this world, what's the deal
The sentence is death and to what court do I appeal?

Punishment for all my sins, I repent
Punishment

Please believe this shit’s real
They wish you bad luck

They want to see you choke
They want to see you broke

It’s uncut 
It’s pure 
It’s not rare 
It’s easy to find
Ignorance breeds hate 
Hate breeds war
Been that way since the beginning of time

The love is fake
But the hate is real
The love is fake 
But the hate is real 

I hate racists, so I’m guilty too
I’m from LA where the red try to kill the blue
I’m from the place where the kids hate the fuckin’ cops
Where the street violence never stops 
Hate is jealousy but some’s deeper than that 
The hater wants you gone
Dead on your back
Love ain’t always fake but I don’t trust it
Hate will have you killed and won’t discuss it
When somebody tells you they love 
That could be just a figure of speech 
They might like you they might be cool with you
But when somebody hates you that shit is real 
They fuckin hate you",,"You need hands to hold someone you care for
When you fear, nobody wants to know you
You need hands to brush away the tears
 
When you hold the brand new baby
You need tender hands to guide them all the way
You need hands to thank the Lord for livin
And forgiving us this day
 
You need hands to show the world you're happy
And you need hands when you have to stop the bus
But the hands that we love so dear
Are the hands that we love to hear
Are the hands that You give to us
Everybody holds the hands that You give to us"

I roam the streets at night

Stalk my prey

Watch your back

Nobody’s safe

You will make it to the grave

You can scream

You won’t be saved

Just the echoes of cries and moans

All I leave is blood and bones

Corpse of the dead considered fresh

I crave for the taste of flesh

Carnivorous it is God’s will

For me to live I have to kill

Sacrifice is made each week

Gut them victims bleed the vein

Nightly news gives my report

Sometimes I just kill for sport

Army’s, countries, gangs, and tribes

Sucker dive for your life when my shotgun scatters
The gangs of L.A. will never die - just multiply

You don't know me, fool
You disown me, cool
I don't need your assistance, social persistence
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My colors, my honor, my colors, my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me, what have I got
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homeboy got jacked
My mother's on crack
My sister can't work cause her arms show tracks

Give me a break, what world do you live in
Death is my set, guess my fuckin religion

the streets are my stage and terror's my show
Psychoanalyse try diagnose me why?
it wasn’t your brother to brutally die
But it was mine, so let me define
my territory don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy

Substitute your lies for fact
I can see right through your plastic mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine looking suit is really made out of sack

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south

I did it my way

There were times
I'm sure you knew
When there was f*ck, f*ck
F*ck all else to do

But through it all
When there was doubt
I shut it up or kicked it down
I faced the wall and the world
And did it my way

I've loved and been a snide
I've had my fill, uh
My share of losing
And now the tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think, I killed a cat
And might I say
Not in the die way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a brat
What has he got
When he wears hats
And he cannot
Say the things he truly feels

But only the words
Of one who kneels
The record shows
I've stuffed a bloke
And did it my way"

Listen to this then

It was on the good ship Venus
By Christ, ya should've seen us
The figurehead was a whore in bed
And the mast, a mammoth penis

The captain of this lugger
He was a dirty bugger
He wasn't fit to shovel shit
From one place to another

Friggin' in the riggin'

By Christ, he was a gorgon
Ten times a day sweet tunes he'd play
On his fuckin' organ

The first mate's name was Cooper
By Christ he was a trooper
He jerked and jerked until he worked
Himself into a stupor

Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin'
There was f*ck all else to do

Hold on
Give it some bollocks

The second mate was Andy
By Christ, he had a dandy
'Til they crushed his cock on a jagged rock
From cumming in the brandy

The cabin boy was Flipper
He was a fuckin' nipper
He stuffed his ass with broken glass
And circumcised the skipper

Friggin' in the riggin'
Friggin' in the riggin'

The Captain's wife was Mabel
To f*ck she was not able
So the dirty shits, they nailed her tits
Across the barroom table

The Captain had a daughter
Who fell in deep sea water
Delighted squeals we knew the eels
Had found 'er sexual quarters

When you fear, nobody wants to know you

You need tender hands to guide them all the way
You need hands to thank the Lord for livin
And forgiving us this day
 
You need hands to show the world you're happy
And you need hands when you have to stop the bus
But the hands that we love so dear
Are the hands that we love to hear
Are the hands that You give to us
Everybody holds the hands that You give to us"

She just had an abortion
She was a case of insanity
Her name was Pauline she lived in a tree

She was a no-one who killed her baby
She sent her letters from the country
She was an animal
She was a bloody disgrace

Body I'm not an animal
Mummy I'm not an abortion

Dragged on a table in a factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in a lavatory
Die little baby screaming

Body screaming fucking bloody mess
It's not an animal it's an abortion

Body I'm not an animal
Body I'm not an abortion

Throbbing squirm, gurgling bloody mess
I'm not a discharge I'm not a loss in
Protein I'm not a throbbing squirm Ah!

F*ck this and f*ck that
F*ck it all and f*ck the fucking brat

I don't want to baby that looks like that.

How many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the N.M.E.
I use anarchy

Its the only way to be

Is this the MPLA
Or is this the UDA
Or is this the IRA

Or just another country
Another council tenancy
