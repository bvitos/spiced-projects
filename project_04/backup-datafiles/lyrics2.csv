It's already on, they shooting the cops
They pushing the line, racism is high

These fools will get us all killed, don't tell me they won't
There's guns on the streets, it's already too late
The net's overloaded with pure racial hate
Depressed, just instigate, they love a fight
Don't give a f*ck about who gets hurt just news that night
They try and twist the problem like it's white and black
But if you come to shoot me, yo I'm shooting back

"Police are hunting for two suspects in a violent home invasion
They are worried that these men may strike again

I got no plans for gettin' loot legal
All black gear on 12 inch suppressor
44 foot desert eagle
Layin' in your parkin' lot, creeping in your lobby (resist)
No problem pushin' holes through your fuckin' body
You can't escape me, if I want what you got
You can't evade me, no chance to call the cops
I'm doin' my job, this is just what I do
You make money, I come and visit you

I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid
The ski mask way
I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid
The ski mask way

I'm in your rear view, when you leave the club
How cold could I be, you look like food to me
All on Instagram, showin' that cash off
What you really hope, is I don't take this mask off 
Don't make me punish you don't want to hurt your wife
Come up off that watch, it ain't worth your life
I gotta crew of wolves, life has no meaning
We roll late night and hunt human beings

I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid
The ski mask way
I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid

Okay you know what the f*ck this is pay attention everybody move against that wall
Get down on your knees lock your fingers behind your mutha fuckin' head now

You know the combination bring your punk ass over here 
I will blow your mutha fuckin' brains out
You gonna open that mutha Fuckin' safe right now

Open the mutha fuckin' safe now, mutha fucka this is business nigga

Big jewels we might come to visit you
Flash cash we might come to visit you

"People always wanna know 
The reason for what they consider senseless violence in the hood
I'ma break it down for you 
This is why we ride

And this is why we ride
And this is why we ride

I gotta say this clear, I gotta say this loud
I should've been dead, don't know how I'm here now
I should've been dead, damn it forty years ago
How the f*ck did I survive? Something that I'll never know
I played the crack game, gang bang, guns
Motherfuckers told me I'd never see twenty one

I come from LA, deep in the heart of the hood
Every night the bullets fly, this shit ain't Hollywood
Could be your best friend, mother or brother dead
Cops can't do shit, these streets are blood red
So we leave the block and we load the guns
And we want revenge, until revenge comes

And this is why we ride

And this is why we ride

I made it out the hood, I got a great life
But them bullets fly every motherfucking night
Another kid dies every motherfucking night
Another mother cries every motherfucking night
Ghettoes of deep crack, made to never escape
A place to store the poor, made to never escape
They're all over the world, people go to die
Murders go unsolved, I understand why
They remove hope and then we sell dope
Pain in poverty has us at each other's throat
Families are broken and so we gang bang
A bit form of unity but most love some of us ever seen

And this is how we die

And this is why we ride

Oh man, coming up and surviving in the ghetto
The smallest argument goes from little drama to big drama 
Next thing you know, somebody's dead
I don't think you can understand if you've never been in your streets 
And held your best friend in your arms
Your child in your arms and watch them breathe their last breath 
'Cause somebody shot them dead in the streets 
You ain't thinking of calling the police
You want revenge and you want it now 
I gotta be honest with you 
If somebody were to kill me, shoot me right now, 
My last words wouldn't be peace 
It would be get those motherfuckers

(And this is why we ride)

This song is dedicated to all of you who has lost somebody to street violence

And this is why we ride

And this is how we die",Body+Count
"I thought you were my friend
I gave you my trust
I would've died for you
Then the second I turn my back
you f*ck me over?
All love is lost

Now you have the nerve to tell me you're sorry?
All love is lost
You've got to be out of your motherfucking mind
All love is lost
You never loved me, you never fucking did
All love is lost
Once you betrayed me that is the fucking end
All love is lost

I don't give a f*ck 'bout what you do with your life
I don't give a f*ck 'bout what you do with your life
I don't give a f*ck 'bout what you do with your life
I don't give a f*ck 'bout what you do with your life

I don't give a f*ck about you, you can fucking die
I couldn't fucking care less when you fucking cry
My heart's so cold, you left a broken soul
You destroyed everything I thought was true
And now you talk shit cause I don't give a f*ck
And now I'm long gone, focus on you
I don't care where you are, don't care what you do
You say you hate me? Cool, I fucking hate you
(Hate you)

All love is lost
All love is lost
You never loved me, you never fucking did
All love is lost
Once you betrayed me that is the fucking end

You see you the kind of motherfucker with no honour
The kind of motherfucker with no loyalty
Motherfucker you can't trust
Cross me, and then you want another chance?

One strike and I don't care about your fucking life
You're not no friend to me, you're fucking dead to me
Don't give a f*ck about the shit that you was going through
You did some shit to me that I could never do to you
'Cuase I'm not no fake champ, I'm not no punk bitch
You're lucky I ain't put your ass in some dark ditch
And now you want some type of sympathy from me now?
If you were stabbed on the floor I'd watch you bleed out

H - is for the Hell I unleash
A - arise the Apocalypse
T - I am your Terror
E - destroy the Enemy

People say I'm cold-hearted
Why?
Cause you fucked over me?
Cause you broke every promise you to me?
Because you said you were my friend and then you stabbed me in my motherfucking

"I spent my life between the light blue lines of loose leaf
I spent my time between impressionable minds and true beef
I spent my days up, my nights up, it's too hard to sleep
Look at my face, it's not the one of someone at peace
I carry guns when I don't need to, but my mind's so fucked
I see assassins coming out of the rough
I keep my doors locked, windows shut, shades down, so pound
Waiting on some Satans who may think of invading
When I do sleep I dream about pain and unrest
About gunfights and dum-dums exploding my chest
I see my boys that've died sitting with me again
And when I wake I realize that I've lost most of my friends
Will my past come back to get me?
Will them bosses that we shot come back to wreck me?
I'm paranoid, it ain't easy when your lifestyle was grimy and greasy
I'm trying to make peace with the karma and the drama

"I fought the darkness
That would've crippled most men
You've never seen it
Disgaged from a poison pen
I'm not like you
Motherfucker, don't you forget it
Walk straight down a venomous road
Soak it up just so I can spit it

How can you understand me
I don't fucking understand myself
How can you even help me
I gotta play the fucking hand I'm dealt
I fight to control it
The monsters inside my brain
Decimate my enemies
Slow torture, bottomless pain

Walk with me
Into the darkest recesses of my mind
Where no one is safe
Come with me
Into the darkest recesses of my mind
Where no one escapes

You're staring at me
You don't see what I am
A deadly viper
In the skin of a normal man
I dwell in shadows
Motherfucker, you are my enemy
The eyes of a snake see visions of the end
I fall like the night and take you down with me

The beast is unleashed
Upon victims verse after verse
I place my hands on my forehead
And the violence pours out like a curse
In the day I seem normal
And I smile and joke and laugh
When I write late at night
I'm a murdering sociopath

Walk with me
Into the darkest recesses of my mind
Where no one is safe
Come with me
Into the darkest recesses of my mind
Where no one escapes

No one is safe
No one escapes
There's no escape

Walk with me
Into the darkest recesses of my mind
Where no one is safe

"Another night I sit alone in the dark
I can't remember my name, I stalk streets and parks
Shame on the victims whose lifes intersect with mine
Massive contusions, rivers of crimson wine
Dismemberments is all that I'm remembering
Bloodstains, pieces of brains under my fingernails
Screams, kicks, fights, bruises, and yells
Nobody lives so nobody tells
I wake up in my house all alone
Bloody sheets, mud on my feet
Next to me, utensils of death, I can't front son
Knives, razor blades, axes, and guns
Look in my chest, I got this ill ass cut
I get the needle and thread and sew it up
Raise the shades and it's night again
You'll hear the shouts

Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out

Two ladies out late walking their dogs
They're old, the city is damned from the fault
I approach from the back with the speed of a shark
Cloaked by dark, I rip their backs apart
The violence is incredibly sexual to me
I'm a blood fiend, makes me bust nuts in my jeans
Yeah, I think I want to keep their heads
I love to peel off their faces and wear their dead skin to bed
The dogs bark and bite at my feet
As I leave they drag their headless bodies down the street
I make it home, take a bath
The water turns red in the aftermath
I wake again and it's night
I passed out, no doubt

Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out

Make it stop
Make the voices stop
Make it stop, please
Stop

My mind echoes with voices of terror
My next victim is in the mirror
Seems like I've seen him before, I can't quite recollect
All I know is that the voices say ""Slice his neck""
I cut off his hand, the blood sprayed from his wrist
And burst, it felt warm when it quenched my thirst
I stabbed him in the eye with my knife made of surgical steel
Oh what a feel
Electrical shocks ripped my brain
Pain like I never felt before, sweet pain
I love it, I love it and I want more
Pulled out my straight razor blade in his juggular
I'm looking at the ceiling now
I wonder where he went and how
He couldn't escape, not in that state
I transcended through the gates of hell and met my soul mate
South of heaven and the devil is my final vouch
You'll hear the shouts

Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out
Here I go again, check me out",Body+Count
"It's unfortunate that we even have to say 'Black Lives Matter'
I mean, if you go through history nobody ever gave a f*ck
I mean, you can kill black people in the street, nobody goes to jail, nobody goes to prison
But when I say 'Black Lives Matter' and you say 'All Lives Matter'
That's like if I was to say 'Gay Lives Matter' and you say 'All Lives Matter'
If I said, 'Women's Lives Matter' and you say 'All Lives Matter', you're diluting what I'm saying
You're diluting the issue
The issue isn't about everybody, it's about black lives, at the moment
But the truth of the matter is, they don't really give a f*ck about anybody
If you break this shit all the way down to the low fucking dirty-ass truth

We say that 'Black Lives Matter'
Well truthfully they really never have
No one ever really gave a f*ck
Just read your bullshit history books
But honestly it ain't just black
It's yellow, it's brown, it's red
It's anyone who ain't got cash
Poor whites that they call trash

They can't, f*ck with us
Once they realise we're all on the same side
They can't, split us up
And let them prosper off the divide
They can't, f*ck with us
Once they realize we're all on the same side
They can't, split us up
And let them prosper off the divide

Don't fall for the bait and switch
Racism is real, but not it
They f*ck whoever can't fight back
But now we gotta change all that
The people have had enough
Right now, it's them against us
This shit is ugly to the core
When it comes to the poor
No lives matter
 
America's always been
A place that judge my skin
And racism is real as f*ck
Ain't no way to play that off
And in the eyes of the law
Black skin has always stood for poor
This is basic shit
They know who they fucking with

They can't, f*ck with us
Once they realise we're all on the same side
They can't, split us up
And let them prosper off the divide
They can't, f*ck with us
Once they realize we're all on the same side

But now we gotta change all that
The people have had enough
Right now, it's them against us
This shit is ugly to the core
When it comes to the poor
No lives matter

You never see them pulling rich people out of their cars in their neighbourhoods because they know they got lawyers
They know they'll sue their ass
They can tell who to f*ck with
Unfortunately, black or brown skin has always meant poor
They're profiling you kid
They know you can't fight back, but we about to

Investigators say they are reviewing body camera and dashcam video of Tuesday's shooting
Police say that Keith Lamont Scott did have a gun in his hand when an officer shot him
But a new picture of the scene shows something at Scott's feet
A source tells our Charlotte affiliate it may be a gun
But people in the neighbourhood say the father of four was holding a book instead

Officer Vinson was in plain clothes when the shooting happened
He was not wearing a body worn camera
But we are told that three other officers wore theirs
The department is under increasing pressure to release police videos from the shooting
But the police chief says he will not do that right now because of the investigation (ladies and gentlemen. This shit is deeper than racism)

Don't fall for the bait and switch
Racism is real, but not it
They f*ck whoever can't fight back
But now we gotta change all that
The people have had enough
Right now, it's them against us

"Since the beginning of time, humans have killed each other because they disagree
The human is the only animal that actually kills for sport
The ability to kill is as innate as our ability to love
When someone hurts me I want revenge, I want them in pain, I want them dead

I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust

I'm a carnivore, I can eat meat raw
I destroy almost everything I touch
I got a quick fuse, trip and I murder you
And forget you, more bullets the better
I can't explain it though, it makes me feel good
Zombie apocalypse, I live for the gore
Give me suicide, serial massacre
Execution yo, I always want more
I love the punishment, I love to dish it out
I want blood, motherfuck a submission
It's deep inside of me, violent tendencies
Like a scalpel when it makes its incision

I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust

I've got a love (It's a lust for blood)
I've got a love (It's a lust for blood)
I've got a love (It's a lust for blood)
I've got a love

Sometimes I wonder am I somehow aroused by this shit
Then I wonder why certain people are pleased by others' pain

I've always had this, this ain't nothing new
This fucking sickness, probably the same as you
I love brutality, it makes my pulse rot
I mean fatality, bodies in dark skies
It's in my DNA, I don't care what you think
It's running through my veins, animal instinct
Make me mad, I want you to die
Different politics, millions of homicides
I get my rocks off letting these Glocks off
Cross me wrong, get your ass crossed up
I'm the human species, the most violent on Earth
I killed my own planet, I'm so sick that it hurts

I destroy almost everything I touch
I got a quick fuse, trip and I murder you
And forget you, more bullets the better
I can't explain it though, it makes me feel good
Zombie apocalypse, I live for the gore
Give me suicide, serial massacre
Execution yo, I always want more
I love the punishment, I love to dish it out
I want blood, motherfuck a submission

Then I wonder why certain people are pleased by others' pain

I've always had this, this ain't nothing new
This fucking sickness, probably the same as you
I love brutality, it makes my pulse rot
I mean fatality, bodies in dark skies
It's in my DNA, I don't care what you think
It's running through my veins, animal instinct
Make me mad, I want you to die
Different politics, millions of homicides
I get my rocks off letting these Glocks off
Cross me wrong, get your ass crossed up

You bond with them, they become your boys
Two months later you're all deployed
Now damn rain, shit gets real
Enemy shoot back, confirm your kills
You learn firsthand, PTST,
Your best friends kill, by IED
You watch your whole team get blown apart
You catch a frag in a purple heart
You write back home, you lost your pride
This struggle with God is a suicide
To this country you gave your life
And we must respect your sacrifice

I, I will always love you
I, I will always love you
I, I will always love you
We, we always will love you
We, we always will love you
We always will love you
Always will love you
Always will love you
Always will love you
Always will love you

This goes out to my fellow vets
Sometimes you come home, you don't get the respect you deserve
You don't get the love and the praise that you should
Well, I'm here to give it to you right now
A lot of times people don't realize
That the freedoms we have here
People have thought and died for it
Giving their lives
Come on, man
I love you!

I, I will always love you
I, I will always love you
I, I will always love you
We, we always will love you
We, we always will love you
We always will love you
Always will love you
Always will love you

Right here'll be your resting place.
Some ol' sucka, yo, he tried to put a move on me

They like a nigga like me 'cause I'm a known crook,
And my posse's down, we don't mess around,

You'll be six feet underground.

"Aw yeah, what's up out there? BC's in the house. Right
About now, I want to tell you a little love story, you know
What I'm sayin', this is a Body Count love story check out
The lyrics, you know, I'm a tell you 'bout what happened
When we went down South last year on tour.

Out on tour yo, I been all around the world
Went to Georgia, met this fine-assed white girl,
Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits and thighs,
The kinda girl that would knock out most guys.
She got wild in the backstage bathroom,
Sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum,
Said ""I love you, but my daddy don't play,
He's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK.""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

You know what I'm sayin'. So we was down South fallin' in
Love, you know, D-Roc had this Nazi girl, my man
Mooseman had a skinhead, I fell in love with Tipper Gore's
Two twelve year old nieces. It was wild, you know what I'm
Sayin', it got even worse, you know.

So one night they took us to a meetin'
White sheets, white hoods, no room for seatin'
There was Skinheads, Nazi's and crazies,
Talkin' 'bout black people pushin' up daisies.
They hated Blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans,
Mexicans, Chinese, even the Indians.
We had our hoods on,
We were slick
She pushed her butt up hard against my dick.
Then her daddy jumped on the stage
Talkin' 'bout killin' in a goddamn rage.
I got mad, my dick got hard
Entered in her ass
She said, ""Oh my God!""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves
Everybody. We love Mexican girls, Black girls, Oriental girls,
It really don't matter. If you from Mars, and you got a pussy,
We will f*ck you. You know, that's all we're sayin', word.

So every year when Body Count comes around
We throw an orgy in every little Southern town.
KKK's, Skinheads, and Nazi
Girls break their necks
To get to the party.
It ain't like their men can't nut,
Their dick's too little
And they just can't f*ck.
So we get buck wild with the white freaks
We show them how to really work the white sheets.
I know her daddy'll really be after me,
When his grandson's named little Ice-T.

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.",Body+Count

Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits and thighs,
The kinda girl that would knock out most guys.
She got wild in the backstage bathroom,
Sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum,
Said ""I love you, but my daddy don't play,
He's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK.""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

You know what I'm sayin'. So we was down South fallin' in
Love, you know, D-Roc had this Nazi girl, my man
Mooseman had a skinhead, I fell in love with Tipper Gore's
Two twelve year old nieces. It was wild, you know what I'm
Sayin', it got even worse, you know.

So one night they took us to a meetin'
White sheets, white hoods, no room for seatin'
There was Skinheads, Nazi's and crazies,
Talkin' 'bout black people pushin' up daisies.
They hated Blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans,
Mexicans, Chinese, even the Indians.
We had our hoods on,
We were slick
She pushed her butt up hard against my dick.
Then her daddy jumped on the stage
Talkin' 'bout killin' in a goddamn rage.
I got mad, my dick got hard
Entered in her ass
She said, ""Oh my God!""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves
Everybody. We love Mexican girls, Black girls, Oriental girls,
It really don't matter. If you from Mars, and you got a pussy,
We will f*ck you. You know, that's all we're sayin', word.

So every year when Body Count comes around
We throw an orgy in every little Southern town.
KKK's, Skinheads, and Nazi
Girls break their necks
To get to the party.
It ain't like their men can't nut,
Their dick's too little
And they just can't f*ck.
So we get buck wild with the white freaks
We show them how to really work the white sheets.
I know her daddy'll really be after me,
When his grandson's named little Ice-T.

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.",Body+Count
"Look outside my window,
I still see a fucked up world
Waking up to helicopter and car alarams,
Does this happen where you live?
Gunshots sound in my my mind
I don't flinch anymore
When I see niggas in my hood,
They're holdin' their dicks tight

Yo, f*ck my landlord
I'm a step away from clearing this shotgun
To erase the problem
Does this happen where you live?
Just had steak and lobster last night
Now I gotta rob a liquor store
But it seems so normal
Because it's necessary evil

[Chorus]

Car hit my dog, babies die, raped in a
Stairwell, cop killed a little girl,
Armed robbery, shooter of a drive-by,
Smokin' cain, sellin' joints in jr High
Head from a minor, sex with animals,
Butthole surfers, a fucked up rehearsal,
Lost pawn ticket, wrecked my father's car
Can't pay my school loan, major jack move,
Holy underwear
Stuck in the pen, forced in a gang, plain
Wrapped food,
Fucked up presidents, sleepin' through trash day
Hit a police car, gettin' laid off, gotta pay
Taxes, gridlock traffic,
Jealous muthafuckas, bitch tried to do me,
Hit and run,
I got a fat bitch pregnant

Necessary evil

Little white kid with a cool-aid smile
Training wheels on his bike thought the
Called me a nigga
Pushed that little bastard in traffic so graphic,
He was holdin' his bike tight
He was a victim of fucked up explaining
An american example of fucked training
When the fuckin' bus connected, he flew like knievel
I was just necessary evil

Eh, yeah dude I understand what you're trying to-


I mean to be honest Ice T, I don't even think you should be in rock any more, I I I I can't feel what you do.

Understand why you feel that I am
Someone you can id with, how?
When you and I come from two totally polar opposite lifestyles.
Under normal circumstances I would be
Waking you and your rich parents up at gunpoint.
Demanding the combination to the wall safe.
While your little sister screams suffering from pistol-whipped pain.
Or looking back at you in a courtroom
Filled with absolutely none of my peers.
Why are you here? Is this some voyeuristic bullshit?
See black man sing?
Or maybe, just maybe, you've been subjected to so many audio drive by's
And gang shootings that you yourself have
Become numb to the pain like me.
And you, check this out, have become
Insane from overdoses of reality.
Well stomach this, at the rate we're
Going right now white boy, yeah you, you
And I will die holding each other's throats.
That's real, the world's at war, we're at war.
Check yourself, don't be me check your goddamn self.

Lasers rip through my neighborhood at night, time is short.
Homocide is the number one sport.

Last days,
These are the last days.

So now that all the reality's soaked, I and
You start to reanalyze every word I ever said, am I a racist?
Or am I just someone who tells it how the f*ck it is?
Well the truth of the thing is I was raised on crime.
Walking through an environment so filled with so much hate,
Honesty I do not feel that you are able to
Comprehend the magnitude of the evil.
But trip this, there were no white faces there.
Just black on black genocide.
The only white men there were the cops
That showed up late in the fourth to outline
The teenaged bodies in chalk.
So who do I hate? Do I hate you? Do I hate myself?
Or possibly am I intelligent enough to only
Hold the conditions of the ghetto itself to blame? - Not!
Who creates the conditions?
Who stops affirmative action and welfare?
Who loves the 3 strikes law?
Didn't see 'em at the Million Man March,
Or the three hundred and fifty-thousand
Man march, let your daddy tell it.
There's a lotta lies out there, what side ya on?
Armageddon is near,
I am the fourth rider of the apocalypse, recognize game.

Last days, these are the last days.
Last days, these are the last days.
Last days, these are the last days.

(But maybe I'm all wrong, maybe everything is ok.
Maybe we're all just gonna get along.
Maybe I'm trippin', maybe life is perfect - yeah right)

I hate you, you hate me, and what does that equal?
It equals nothing, and that's exactly what we're gonna have,
Nothing, I we don't make a change soon,
And who am I to tell you anything?
I ain't nobody but a brother from South Central,
Who's had the opportunity to go around the world,
And I found out that we're all not really that different.

Muthafuckas sleep
I crawl in through your window and I
Muthafuckin' creep
I catch you little punk ass kids asleep in your beds,
And I take out my knife and I cut off your
Muthafuckin' heads
I want your last breath
I want your last breath

[Chorus]
You're not dreamin'
You're not alone

Oh I want your last breath, your
Last breath, your last breath
I want your last breath

So you go downstairs to see if everything is alright
You're afraid you're alone and it's late on a rainy night
Are you asleep or awake you don't know
As you turn around,
And my rusty blade cuts you open and you hit the ground
I want your last breath
I want your last breath

I won't die in your bullshit wars no more
I won't fight to my death for you
I won't watch my poor mama cry no more
Muthafuck your red, white and blue

Thousands of men go to war to fight for
Politics which they don't understand
Murder people who they never met
When they make it home they're
Considered a vet
Fire drops from the sky as the young boys die

Far from home, all alone, it's a sin
All you get in return in a shit shallow grave
Cause in war there's no way you can win

Mia, yeah right, you think they give a f*ck,
You're just pawns in the game off the board
Brainwashed to the point where you kill at
The drop of a dime
But it's not called a crime
Vietnam, persian gulf, did we win ? Did we lose ?
Thousands die, human beings you choose
Once in you're owned by the man,
Uncle sam is his name, you're his slave,
Shallow graves

Murder, death

As I search to analyze reality, the true
Meaning of life,
Out simple existence means nothing
God has a gun, the truth, life is a slow noose
He's invincible
Better watch his knife,
There is no escape from the slow kill
When it's time to go god serves a death blow,
You have no choice, don't even try
The only choice is suicide

Surviving the game

No escape

No one's ever escaped

I still see a fucked up world
Waking up to helicopter and car alarams,
Does this happen where you live?
Gunshots sound in my my mind
I don't flinch anymore
When I see niggas in my hood,
They're holdin' their dicks tight

Yo, f*ck my landlord
I'm a step away from clearing this shotgun
To erase the problem
Does this happen where you live?
Just had steak and lobster last night
Now I gotta rob a liquor store
But it seems so normal
Because it's necessary evil

Car hit my dog, babies die, raped in a
Stairwell, cop killed a little girl,
Armed robbery, shooter of a drive-by,
Smokin' cain, sellin' joints in jr High
Head from a minor, sex with animals,
Butthole surfers, a fucked up rehearsal,
Lost pawn ticket, wrecked my father's car
Can't pay my school loan, major jack move,
Holy underwear
Stuck in the pen, forced in a gang, plain
Wrapped food,
Fucked up presidents, sleepin' through trash day
Hit a police car, gettin' laid off, gotta pay
Taxes, gridlock traffic,
Jealous muthafuckas, bitch tried to do me,
Hit and run,
I got a fat bitch pregnant

Necessary evil

Little white kid with a cool-aid smile
Training wheels on his bike thought the
Called me a nigga
Pushed that little bastard in traffic so graphic,
He was holdin' his bike tight
He was a victim of fucked up explaining
An american example of fucked training
When the fuckin' bus connected, he flew like knievel
I was just necessary evil

What I'm sayin', this is a Body Count love story check out
The lyrics, you know, I'm a tell you 'bout what happened
When we went down South last year on tour.

Out on tour yo, I been all around the world
Went to Georgia, met this fine-assed white girl,
Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits and thighs,
The kinda girl that would knock out most guys.
She got wild in the backstage bathroom,
Sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum,
Said ""I love you, but my daddy don't play,
He's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK.""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

You know what I'm sayin'. So we was down South fallin' in
Love, you know, D-Roc had this Nazi girl, my man
Mooseman had a skinhead, I fell in love with Tipper Gore's
Two twelve year old nieces. It was wild, you know what I'm
Sayin', it got even worse, you know.

So one night they took us to a meetin'
White sheets, white hoods, no room for seatin'
There was Skinheads, Nazi's and crazies,
Talkin' 'bout black people pushin' up daisies.
They hated Blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans,
Mexicans, Chinese, even the Indians.
We had our hoods on,
We were slick
She pushed her butt up hard against my dick.
Then her daddy jumped on the stage
Talkin' 'bout killin' in a goddamn rage.
I got mad, my dick got hard
Entered in her ass
She said, ""Oh my God!""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves
Everybody. We love Mexican girls, Black girls, Oriental girls,
It really don't matter. If you from Mars, and you got a pussy,
We will f*ck you. You know, that's all we're sayin', word.

So every year when Body Count comes around
We throw an orgy in every little Southern town.
KKK's, Skinheads, and Nazi
Girls break their necks
To get to the party.
It ain't like their men can't nut,
Their dick's too little
And they just can't f*ck.
So we get buck wild with the white freaks
We show them how to really work the white sheets.
I know her daddy'll really be after me,
When his grandson's named little Ice-T.

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,

"No, no, no, Momma

All my life I loved this girl so much,
All my life I loved her simple touch.
She cared for me and put me on this earth,
Oh the pain of just a simple birth.
But now I find that she has left me dumb and blind,
Poisoned, twisted, and destroyed my mind.
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race
That's why I hate you!
There's only one way I can make it right,
Momma's gotta die tonight.
There's only one way I can make it right,
Momma's gotta die tonight.

Momma, momma, I always loved my momma,
I always loved my momma.
I loved the way she hold me,
I love the way she talked to me.
She used to teach me a lot of things,
She taught me good things, she taught me bad things.
""Don't trust white people, don't trust white people.
Don't trust white people, they're no good, they're no good,
They're no good, they're no good.
They're just gonna rip you off, they're just gonna rip you off.
Don't trust 'em, don't trust 'em.""
I said, ""Why momma?"", she said, ""I told you don't
Trust 'em they're no good.""
I said, ""Momma, I thought we were all the same momma,
Why momma?"" She said, ""Don't ask me any questions.
Don't you challenge your mutha."" Momma.

So one day I found I fell in love
And I brought my girlfriend home
And I introduced her to my mutha and
She smacked me, was a white girl and
I said, ""Why momma? Why momma? What did I do wrong?""
You know, I found out my mutha was a evil woman.
She hated Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Jamaicans,
Indians, Orientals, momma was no good.
I learned to hate my mutha, hate my mutha.
So I got some, ha ha, some lighter fluid, from the corner store
And I put it around her bed, and I set her on fire!
Ha, ha, ha.
Burn momma, burn momma, burn momma, burn bitch
Burn, burn, burrrrrn. Ha, ha, ha. Burn you racist bitch!
Ha, ha, ha.
But she wasn't quite dead. She jumped up from the bed
And I grabbed my Louisville Slugger that she had bought
Me for my twelfth birthday and I came up behind her and
I hit her, I hit her, I hit her twice. Ha, ha, ha.
Now she was out.
I went into the kitchen
And I got that handy carving knife
That we only use on special occasions like
Bullshit Thanksgiving, and I took her and I laid her ol'
Fucked up corpse on the floor and I cut her in
Little bitty pieces. Cut off her arms, her feet,
Her neck, and I put her into little green hefty bags
And I put it into my car and I said, ""Momma, we're goin' on
A vacation, a permanent vacation bitch.""
I took some of her around the world to Arizona, New York,
Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Oakland. Ha, ha, ha, yo, you
Want to go to Connecticut, bitch. Ohio, Detroit, Texas, L.A.
Whose laughin' now momma, whose laughin' now bitch,
Whose laughin' now.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

So if you got a mutha or a grandmutha or a father
Who wants to carry on the same racist bullshit that's
Fucked this world up from day one,
You can either look 'em in the face and tell 'em to
Suck your dick or do like Body Count does.

All my life I loved this girl so much,
All my life I loved her simple touch.

Censor records, tv, school books too

Freedom of speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
Pmrc, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm sayin'? fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind

About now, I want to tell you a little love story, you know
What I'm sayin', this is a Body Count love story check out
The lyrics, you know, I'm a tell you 'bout what happened
When we went down South last year on tour.

Out on tour yo, I been all around the world
Went to Georgia, met this fine-assed white girl,
Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits and thighs,
The kinda girl that would knock out most guys.
She got wild in the backstage bathroom,
Sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum,
Said ""I love you, but my daddy don't play,
He's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK.""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

You know what I'm sayin'. So we was down South fallin' in
Love, you know, D-Roc had this Nazi girl, my man
Mooseman had a skinhead, I fell in love with Tipper Gore's
Two twelve year old nieces. It was wild, you know what I'm
Sayin', it got even worse, you know.

So one night they took us to a meetin'
White sheets, white hoods, no room for seatin'
There was Skinheads, Nazi's and crazies,
Talkin' 'bout black people pushin' up daisies.
They hated Blacks, Jews, Puerto Ricans,
Mexicans, Chinese, even the Indians.
We had our hoods on,
We were slick
She pushed her butt up hard against my dick.
Then her daddy jumped on the stage
Talkin' 'bout killin' in a goddamn rage.
I got mad, my dick got hard
Entered in her ass
She said, ""Oh my God!""

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, mutha f*ck her dear old dad.

So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves
Everybody. We love Mexican girls, Black girls, Oriental girls,
It really don't matter. If you from Mars, and you got a pussy,
We will f*ck you. You know, that's all we're sayin', word.

So every year when Body Count comes around
We throw an orgy in every little Southern town.
KKK's, Skinheads, and Nazi
Girls break their necks
To get to the party.
It ain't like their men can't nut,
Their dick's too little
And they just can't f*ck.
So we get buck wild with the white freaks
We show them how to really work the white sheets.
I know her daddy'll really be after me,
When his grandson's named little Ice-T.

I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she fucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, love it when she sucks me though,
I, I, I love my KKK bitch, she loves it when I treat her bad,

All my life I loved her simple touch.
She cared for me and put me on this earth,
Oh the pain of just a simple birth.
But now I find that she has left me dumb and blind,
Poisoned, twisted, and destroyed my mind.
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race
That's why I hate you!
There's only one way I can make it right,
Momma's gotta die tonight.
There's only one way I can make it right,
Momma's gotta die tonight.

Momma, momma, I always loved my momma,
I always loved my momma.
I loved the way she hold me,
I love the way she talked to me.
She used to teach me a lot of things,
She taught me good things, she taught me bad things.
""Don't trust white people, don't trust white people.
Don't trust white people, they're no good, they're no good,
They're no good, they're no good.
They're just gonna rip you off, they're just gonna rip you off.
Don't trust 'em, don't trust 'em.""
I said, ""Why momma?"", she said, ""I told you don't
Trust 'em they're no good.""
I said, ""Momma, I thought we were all the same momma,
Why momma?"" She said, ""Don't ask me any questions.
Don't you challenge your mutha."" Momma.

So one day I found I fell in love
And I brought my girlfriend home
And I introduced her to my mutha and
She smacked me, was a white girl and
I said, ""Why momma? Why momma? What did I do wrong?""
You know, I found out my mutha was a evil woman.
She hated Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Jamaicans,
Indians, Orientals, momma was no good.
I learned to hate my mutha, hate my mutha.
So I got some, ha ha, some lighter fluid, from the corner store
And I put it around her bed, and I set her on fire!
Ha, ha, ha.
Burn momma, burn momma, burn momma, burn bitch
Burn, burn, burrrrrn. Ha, ha, ha. Burn you racist bitch!
Ha, ha, ha.
But she wasn't quite dead. She jumped up from the bed
And I grabbed my Louisville Slugger that she had bought
Me for my twelfth birthday and I came up behind her and
I hit her, I hit her, I hit her twice. Ha, ha, ha.
Now she was out.
I went into the kitchen
And I got that handy carving knife
That we only use on special occasions like
Bullshit Thanksgiving, and I took her and I laid her ol'
Fucked up corpse on the floor and I cut her in
Little bitty pieces. Cut off her arms, her feet,
Her neck, and I put her into little green hefty bags
And I put it into my car and I said, ""Momma, we're goin' on
A vacation, a permanent vacation bitch.""
I took some of her around the world to Arizona, New York,
Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Oakland. Ha, ha, ha, yo, you
Want to go to Connecticut, bitch. Ohio, Detroit, Texas, L.A.
Whose laughin' now momma, whose laughin' now bitch,
Whose laughin' now.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

So if you got a mutha or a grandmutha or a father
Who wants to carry on the same racist bullshit that's
Fucked this world up from day one,
You can either look 'em in the face and tell 'em to
Suck your dick or do like Body Count does.

All my life I loved this girl so much,
All my life I loved her simple touch.
She cared for me and put me on this earth
Oh the pain of just a simple birth.
Right now I find that she has left me dumb and blind
Poisoned, twisted, and destroyed my mind.
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race
That's why I hate you!

Momma's gotta die tonight.

When I’m gone
This is our life
When I’m gone
This is our time

Don’t wait ‘til I’m dead until these words are said
Don’t wait until I die and then start to fake cry
Tell the people that you love that you love ‘em now
Show the people you appreciate just how
How much they mean to ya
How much you care how real it is
They’re right in front of ya
Your family
Your wife
Your kids
Don’t wait for tragedy to tell ‘em how you really feel
Don’t wait

I’ll be lost without you
How do I make it right
How do I take back all the time I’ve wasted alone
How would it make you feel
How would it make you feel
Knowing you had the chance and let it slip away

Don’t wait until I’m dead
You’ve got friends
Tell ‘em that you care
You’ve got family
Tell ‘em how you feel
Don’t wait to say how great a guy I was and all that bullshit

When I’m gone
This is our life
Don’t wait to tell me that you miss me
When I’m gone
This is our time
Don’t wait to tell me that you love me
When I’m gone
This is our life
Don’t wait to tell me that you need me
When I’m gone
This is our life

Seems like every day death comes unexpectedly
Seems like yesterday my man was sittin’ next to me
So many things I could’ve said and that we could’ve done
The reaper’s comin’ but I never thought he’d be the one
I don’t do funerals
Don’t wanna see you in no box
I miss my homies and my love for them will never stop
Don’t have regret and wait until your loved one dies
Now’s your chance
Tell ‘em while they’re still alive

When I’m gone
This is our life
Don’t wait to tell me that you miss me
When I’m gone
This is our time
Don’t wait to tell me that you love me
When I’m gone
This is our life
Too many people pass away every single day
And we don’t show ‘em how we feel until it’s too late
I appreciate or love is something we won’t say
We delay it ‘til they’re gone and say it at their grave
We delay it ‘til they’re gone and say it at their grave

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous? Am I better off dead?

Punishment, for all my sins

A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind

Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate? On the corner rolling dice
Punishment, but I've done nothing wrong
In my eyes, who really pays the price

My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done
Sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got
Though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar, as I kneel down and I
Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of
the truth, whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right
off the roof, 'cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
but now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact that the majority
of the people are out there smoking crack, getting doped up,
shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a
question we all ask and must answer before long, 'cause no one
is safe in this world, what's the deal, the sentence is death and to

"Growing up I've seen a lot of shit in my time
I've seen hunger, hunger, pleasure, pain, violence and crime
I have learned from the mistakes of my friends that have died
And from those who have gone down in life that just never tried
Life is just too short I realize that now
I'm gonna get my shit together and try to make it some how
Cause one thing that I have learned is that you only live once
So now I'll take life by the balls and squeeze until they crunch

Knowledge of the streets, a valuable tool
Type of education you can't get in school
Many hard times, losing friends, getting burned
Nobody to teach me, I just learned
A man like clay molded by his surroundings
He starts to take shape of the beating and the pounding
Assembly line that I've been through
A hard motherfucker with a bad attitude
Maybe its just the times we live in
Maybe its just urban discipline

The ways of urban life are not as they seem
Standing up and fighting is what living here means
In order to survive you've got to earn your respect
The only lessons that you learn are from things that you regret

It's my heart and my mind that I'll always follow, I will not break
Nor will my balls, although that I've seen that you've tried
before
Why are people fake?

Maybe you're older, wiser on your own right, it's your mistake
I'm gonna do my own thing regardless, my choice to make
I am real, in touch with my feelings, and I know my place
You have shown, on the other hand, both sides of your face

I see the world in a different light
Things not always black and white
Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey

I would never try and tell you what was right from wrong
Maybe that's why you feel that I don't belong
Always put me down for things I've said and done
Can't you see it's a war that can't be won

A war that can't be won

Living in your world seems so clear and concise
Shutting out reality makes everything so nice

"What makes us tick
Are we mentally sick
Feeling inside that drive us like pride
Or emotional scars from our friends that have died
And make us build walls so incredible high
They exceed the ceiling from the terrified feelings
Which we often repress and end up depressed
Some vent it as rage, it's the fashion these days
In a twisted society, we drown in anxiety
Has push come to shove, have we killed the dove
Are we caught in a fit, what makes us tick
Has man gone insane, are we feeling the strain
We must dig and must pick at what makes us tick
Has push come to shove, have we killed the dove
Are we caught in the thick as to what makes us tick

No

And dropped a vial of crack

The mind of the youth is forced to weather
An assault on his senses by his parents and peers
That preys on innocence, weakness and fears
Manifestation of rage runs deep
Over the edge of sanity, thoughts creep
Violent reaction, bitter and mean

These eyes have seen inhuman sights

To turn my anger into love and keep my feet planted on the ground.

I seek the truth whatever that may be,
I seek the answers to questions, please God help me.

To look at people and see no color, vision clear of prejudice or spite,
To treat people just like my brother, for this I pray with all my might.
To learn to let go of all my fears and learn to embrace all of my tears,
To search for faith and humility, to walk the path which sets me free.

Salvation, from society, damnation, have mercy on me.

So many lies I told, so many lives I've sold.
So far away from who I am I never understand.
So many things I regret, so many things that I let
Take me away from myself, too late to take it back.

So many dreams I had, so many lives I've lived
So many friends I said goodbye forever
So many times I wish, so many times I dream,

A crooked cop on the take, nothing could be worse
Twenty one gun salute, the widow lays the wreath
The whole police department covered up he was a thief

A real man works hard, starves to climb the ropes
Not killing for money, on the corner selling dope
Money isn't everything, I guess it was to you
Did you control your own life or greed controlled you
For the lives that you destroyed, so morally depraved
For the people you left grieving, I spit on your grave

[Chorus:]

So it seems, this is the system, and I'm sorry to say
Dealers pay the cops to turn and look the other way
On both sides of the law, justice has been done
Not by a judge and jury but by the trigger of gun

[Lead]

Everybody scratches and tries to get ahead
You took the easy way, it is easy being dead
The chamber spins three, grab the trigger then you pull it
The game is called roulette and you just won the bullet

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus 2x]

The chamber spins three",Biohazard
"I question not me, it only happens to others
I can't deny reality as life gets smothered

If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
Cause he who paints the big picture runs the whole scene

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous? Am I better off dead?

Punishment, for all my sins

A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind

Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate? On the corner rolling dice
Punishment, but I've done nothing wrong
In my eyes, who really pays the price

My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done
Sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got
Though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar, as I kneel down and I
Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of
the truth, whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right
off the roof, 'cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
but now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact that the majority
of the people are out there smoking crack, getting doped up,
shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a
question we all ask and must answer before long, 'cause no one
is safe in this world, what's the deal, the sentence is death and to
what court do I appeal?

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

Punishment",Biohazard
"I make now a stand for belief that I'm steadfast
In hating all of the bullshit you give me doubt my future, present and past
Who are you to infringe your values upon me, I've learned the hard way
Stepping on my toes, you've put my back to the wall, my back to the wall

I've been told a thousand times to give respect when due
Why do you find it so hard to believe I've got none for you
It's my heart and my mind that I'll always follow, I will not break
Nor will my balls, although that I've seen that you've tried
before
Why are people fake?

Maybe you're older, wiser on your own right, it's your mistake
I'm gonna do my own thing regardless, my choice to make
I am real, in touch with my feelings, and I know my place
You have shown, on the other hand, both sides of your face

I see the world in a different light
Things not always black and white
Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey

I would never try and tell you what was right from wrong
Maybe that's why you feel that I don't belong
Always put me down for things I've said and done
Can't you see it's a war that can't be won

A war that can't be won

Living in your world seems so clear and concise
Shutting out reality makes everything so nice
Paint a pretty picture black and white everyday
See my tattered canvass bleeding shades of grey

I see the world in a different light
Things not always black and white
Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey",Biohazard
"I'm fed up, I've had it up to there
Tell me what is good for me and my career
F*ck you and your selfish advice
You've never been loyal to the same things twice
In your sheltered little lives, you don't know the scene
Doing as you're told, puppets of the big machine
Changing faces, revolving door hypocrisy
Who do you work for now, yeah, I see

[Chorus I:]

Music's for you and me
Not the fucking industry
You fucking tell us what is cool
You see we came from different schools

You got no crowd but you got a big push
Kissing asses till your pride turns into mush
You might change your style for the record company
Fingers down your throat, you heave your integrity

You're weak, give it up, throw the towel and the flag in
And get your pussy ass of the motherfuckin' bandwagon
Never for a minute were you real in the first place
So far up someone's ass you got shit on your face

[Chorus II:]

Music's for you and me
Not the fucking industry
You fucking tell us what is cool
You see we came from different schools
To us it matters what you say
Not the fucking games you play
You're full of shit, it's plain to see
The whole damn fucking indrusty

If you think for a minute this song's about you
Step the f*ck back, 'cause it's probably true
The message in the music is the reason that we're in this
Music is for you and me, not the fucking industry
Try to tell us what is cool, we came from different schools
It only matters what you say, not the fuckin' games you play
Full of shit, it's plain to see, the whole damn fuckin' industry

[Chorus II]",Biohazard
"Fascism, the epitome of ignorance
Listen up, I'll give you a for instance
People go hating for the color of skin
Won't they learn they'll never win
Play not the hands of the media vultures
We must learn to unite our cultures
Violence constantly tears us apart
Show the world that we've got heart

[Chorus:]

Blood is spilled on black and white
Different colors, why do we fight
Face the facts, stone cold sober
Black and white and red all over

Thousands die and kill each other
Someone rapes and stabs their mother
I think it'ssick to count the death toll
On and on the media rolls
Drive by shootings, homicide
Nobody cares about the mother who cried
A family's grief stepped on by ratings
Understand why I keep hating

It makes no sense for us to be pawns
In the chess game that the media plays

If the streets are where you run
There you die, why? Find yourself a way out

Black and white and red all over

Ruling out the positive and any hope for peace
This will only kill morale, paper sales increase
This shit has got to cease

Black and white and red all over

Believe half of what you read and half what you see
Put two and two together and you'll have reality
Can't you see my reality?

[Chorus]

Turn on the TV and what do I see
Killing, murder and blasphemy
Rape, arsan, robberies
People die of incurable disease
Crashes, bashes, people on crack
Scandal, war and heart attack
Always strife in the middle fucking east
If war sell papers why don't peace",Biohazard
"A man with a promise smashes down my door
He sees a future with me, he's gonna give me more
""Give me all your trust, I'msure you won't regret
Just sign the dotted line, and I'll do so the rest""
He says I can't make it alone, not without him
But I've always been on my own, he doesn't know who I am
And now I'm starting to see just what you are to me
A parasitic leech of my life

[Pre-chorus:]

You feed off the art that I bleed
You're a man with a promise but you ain't shit to me

A man broke his promise and he wants reparations
He sold me up the river, cause me grief and frustration
I gave him all my trust and got stabbed in the back
A lucky motherfucker that he hasn't yet been whacked
You ain't no fucking artist, spend your life exploiting others
Try all you want, you can't break me or my brothers
A business man vulture,no honor, no class
Take your money and your lawyers and shove 'em up your ass

[Pre-chorus II:]

You feed off the art that I bleed
Numbers to you is just pain to me

[Chorus:]

Now the tables are turned
Can't you see motherfucker that you've been burned
You're a man with a promise but you ain't shit to me
You ain't shit to me

"I found a way out, a solution inside
From the things that are bathering me
It's been too long since I felt this way
From your sad life I broke free
Don't ever think that you ripped me apart
And walked away with a price
Cause you can not penetrate my cold heart
ANd fill it with your disease

I wonder now how I lived before
Deaf, dumb, dead and blind
I moved my life forward and I'm never goin' back
And I've left you far behind
There's a lot of things that I've now realized
From the way that you treated me
It's bullshit and it's hatred you epitomized
You were blessed to have been with me

[Chorus:]

You filled my life with your disease
I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees
Disease is flowing through my veins
I'd rather die right now than live in pain

[Lead]

Looking around at the past and the present
Things are so much better now
Your misery wanted my company
But you can't keep a good man down
Whatever made me want to be with you
Is something I can't understand
'cause if I never saw your fucking face again
I'd die a happy man

[Chorus 2x]",Biohazard
"Not even for a second when he wake up did he ask
If today was gonna be his last
An average day in the middle of a life
Terminated by a sharp knife
Killing, spilling the liquid blood
As his boyz found him lying face down in the mud
You might say this song is in poor taste
But I must discuss the waste

[Chorus I:]

Of lives of friends that I have lost
Who pays the price, who pays the cost
Can't cry, just anger till the end
It burns inside to lose a friend

Walking thin lines, anything to cop a dime
Labelled habitual, a loser three times
Just fucking' around, knuckles bloody to the bone
Whatever, the future's unknown
Unless you believe in predestination of fate
The letter read termination
It was fucked up I couldn't make out his face
Through the blod, what a fucking waste

[Chorus I]

[Chorus II:]

My friend was there until the end (my friend)
Can never be replaced
The pain that I taste (It's over)
What a fucking waste

[Chorus I]

Cold blooded murder, suicide, another body laid to rest
Untimely demise, homicide, my faith is put to the test
Is there a god, sometimes I just can't believe
My friend who is dead was shot and then robbed
Something quite hard to conceive
People dying everyday there's got to be a better way
The losses blow my mind away, the stain of blood will always stay
Like the memory of a friend who stood with me until the end
The losses blow my mind away, the stain of blood will always stay

[Chorus I]

[Lead]

It's not for me that I grieve, but for the families left berieved
I question whether life is fair, I wonder if I even care
We think we know what life is worth until they lower us beneath
the earth
Mother crying, forever hurt, my face like stone I shavel dirt

[Chorus II]",Biohazard
"Early man walked away as modern man took control
Their minds weren't quite the same, to conquer was his goal
So he built his great empire and he slaughtered his own kind
Then he died a confused man, killed himself with his own mind

We're gonna die
From our own arrogance",Biohazard
"I sit and pick my brain each night
With an axe in my hand held tight
Bite my nose to spite my face
Killing myself, I can't escape the rat race
Wallowing in neck-deep misery
Quicksand dissent, pressure free
Deepest wounds are self inflicted
Should I hope to be vindicated

Always alone, society's abortion
Self mutilation, the daily partion
Resentful past breeds hopeful future
With tears of blood, I remove the sutures

Dying inside, emotions they hide
Irreparable damage from the tears that I've cried
I climb from the sewer, the years that I have
spent
Self mutilation or my environment

[Chorus: Repeat x2]
Tears of blood, tears of blood
I cry, I cry
Tears of blood, tears of blood
I die

Deny myself for fear of being
Is it over now, has my heart stopped beating
Lying here just self defeating
My mind is empty, it won't stop bleeding
Twisted anger screams my brain
Over the edge, I hang in pain
Mouth locked shut my mind won't swallow
With tears of blood alone I wallow

No one to blame except myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Maybe its just a matter of pride
Too sweet to end with suicide

Peel the scab, pour salt in the wound
Torturing myself, I'm forever doomed
Looking east and west each and every moon
A peaceful rest comes somebody soon

No one to blame expect myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Is death life and do we live in hell?

[Chorus: Repeat x3]",Biohazard
"Look into the yes of a madman
You can see it in his face, he's a weak and sad man
Staring straight ahead, his eyes set like stone
With a nine millimeter cocked at your dome
No way out, it's too late 'cause you're already in it
So what'cha gonna do you'll be dead in a minute
Thinking slow will get you nowhere fast
A young life terminated with one short blast
You live like that, you die like this
That's how it is
Livin' with regret is no way to live
That's how it is
You're dead too soon if the bullet don't miss
That's how it is kid
How it is
That's what you get for
Living like this
With a bullet in your head, you're dead, you can't miss
Ain't no time for regret when you're body is in a bag
Ain't no time to change your mind when your head begins to sag
Should've known better, ain't working for you now
Maybe if you'd know better you'd be here somehow

With a hole in your head that you can see through
You're looking up and you're looking down
Shot's are rippin' out from all around
You're crying out for help but it can't be found
The voice of regret is the only sound

"Population control. The only alternative left was to increase the death rate,
No one wanted to pick people out of a crowd and line them up for execution,
Neither did they relish the possible consequences of an enraged public upon
Discovering that they were being systematically murdered. A very short but
Very deadly global war was contemplated. Something else had to be done that
Would absolve the decision-makers of guilt, something that could be blamed
Upon Mother Nature. The answer, a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
Does not naturally exist for which no natural immunity could have been acquired.
The United States population was infected. The vaccine was administered by the
World health organization. Whatever causes AIDS was in the vaccine
I'm the first in line with a sentence on death row
Take a look around and feel the wind blow
And to those motherfuckers who decide our fate
Annihilate, come together and kill their hate
Cut their heads off and put 'em on a stake
Stuff their bodies in a barrel and throw 'em in the lake
Let the leaches feast on their own
Motherfucker you're wrong, your on your own

We all go to fight for our rights
Stand against those opposed
We all go to fight for our rights

Population control 
Population control

Over population is the most serious threat to the whole future of our species.

Rip their arms off from limb to limb
Make them regret they thought they would win
Cut their tongues out to stop spreading lies
Their poisonous venom has kept me blind
Open your eyes don't you realize
Come together, it's time we rise

"So many things these eyes have seen
People I've met and places I've been
Inconceivable how one maintains
In the game with the pain and the strain on the brain
How reality's plane can wear you down
And make you an insane man who only frowns
City hardened and cold just like me
Anger has numbed my eyes from all they see
From all they see

Like a workingman's skin as it turns to leather
The mind of the youth is forced to weather
An assault on his senses by his parents and peers
That preys on innocence, weakness and fears
Manifestation of rage runs deep
Over the edge of sanity, thoughts creep
Violent reaction, bitter and mean
A product of what these eyes have seen

These eyes have seen inhuman sights
I hold my breath with all my might
Like anyone else in our own hells
It seems obscene, the things I've seen
I hold my breath with all my might
These eyes have seen inhuman sights

Lost count of how many wakes were attended
Mind and body never quite mended
Do you think this is what life intended?
At fourteen your life has ended
Maybe your spirit is battered and broken
From shit you've seen and words that were spoken
Death, violence, drugs all around
These eyes have seen some shit go down

These eyes have seen inhuman sights
I hold my breath with all my might
Like anyone else in our own hells
It seems obscene, the things I've seen",Biohazard

That I'm suffering a burning question of the truth
Whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right off the roof
'Cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
But now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact
That the majority of the people are out there smoking crack
Getting doped up, shooting that shit into their veins
The question must be asked if we have any brains left

Or right or wrong in this song
A question we all ask and must answer before long
'Cause no one is safe in this world, what's the deal
The sentence is death and to what court do I appeal?

Punishment for all my sins, I repent
Punishment

Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee

"Biohazard - Sellout Lyrics 
So many times I've been lied to, blind to
The ways of the world I've been lied to, blind to
I never understand how this master plan speaking man to man
Could ever give a damn
Hypocritical stance don't make me piss in my pants
You never care unless there's money to make
I'll never sacrifice, I got no time in my life
To f*ck around with something that I know is fake
You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

You never understand exactly what kind of man that I am
'till you wear my shoes
You think I envy your life but you never realize I always live the
 way that I
choose
Feel so much regret but you never let
That make you live the truth
You point fingers and lie, the harsh truth you deny
Life is a game that you don't want to lose

You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

and be the one you disrespect and lie to
the one you really want to live your life through
the soul you sell is really your own
because I'm the only one you can never lie to

Chorus:
Sellout-you want to sell your soul
Sellout-you want to take control
Sellout-you want to play that role
Sellout-I'll never sell my soul

Sellout-sell your soul (x2)
Lead
Sellout-sell your soul (x2)

Since back in the day, I've been up in this game
Doing much of the same way, real, I never did it for fame or glory

For all these years, with no respect from my peers
I kept it real and told my story
Sellout-This shit is real and I can never be fake
I'll do whatever it takes within reason
Sellout-Made so many mistakes, never caught any breaks
I live and die for whatever I believe in

Sellout-You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul
and be the one you disrespect and lie to
the one you really want to live your life through
the soul you sell is really your own
because I'm the only one you can never lie to

"Population control. The only alternative left was to increase the death rate,
No one wanted to pick people out of a crowd and line them up for execution,
Neither did they relish the possible consequences of an enraged public upon
Discovering that they were being systematically murdered. A very short but
Very deadly global war was contemplated. Something else had to be done that
Would absolve the decision-makers of guilt, something that could be blamed
Upon Mother Nature. The answer, a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
Does not naturally exist for which no natural immunity could have been acquired.
The United States population was infected. The vaccine was administered by the
World health organization. Whatever causes AIDS was in the vaccine
I'm the first in line with a sentence on death row
Take a look around and feel the wind blow
And to those motherfuckers who decide our fate
Annihilate, come together and kill their hate
Cut their heads off and put 'em on a stake
Stuff their bodies in a barrel and throw 'em in the lake
Let the leaches feast on their own
Motherfucker you're wrong, your on your own

[Chorus]
We all go to fight for our rights
Stand against those opposed
We all go to fight for our rights

Population control 
Population control

Over population is the most serious threat to the whole future of our species.

Rip their arms off from limb to limb
Make them regret they thought they would win
Cut their tongues out to stop spreading lies
Their poisonous venom has kept me blind
Open your eyes don't you realize
Come together, it's time we rise

[Chorus: x2]

[Repeat: x4]
Population Control 

The vaccine was administered by the world health organization.

The cure will be administered to the survivors when it is decided
That enough people have died.",Biohazard
"Pain inside me is taking over again
Wide awake I open my eyes into a nightmare of a life that I despise I gotta,
break it down to the bare essentials 'cause life's too short to be sentimental.
Twisting around inside my head so many crazy visions - am I better off dead?
Filled with dread - gun under the bed to clip all the motherfuckers trying
to keep me down, I ain't fuckin' around.
Wide awake my eyes are open I can't breathe my heart is choking and I can't speak
the words unspoken and I can't believe my life is broken again... (my life is broken)

Keep trying to tell myself ""everything will be OK, everything will go my way""
'till life steps in and slaps on the strangle, tears flow and fists start to mangle.
I wake up screaming everyday, nobody pays attention when I'm writhing in pain,
I got a glitch in my brain I gotta break free from anxiety, I gotta let go of life
'cause it's killing me

[Chorus:]
Wide awake my eyes are open I can't breathe my heart is choking and I can't speak
the words unspoken and I can't believe my life is broken again...
My eyes are open, my heart is choking, on words unspoken, my life is broken again

I can't believe my life is broken apart again, I can't conceive my time was never
well spent, sick of everybody talking about the things they never do, motherfuckers
talking shit about who?
YOU!!

Pain inside me is taking over again

How many times can you ask for a chance and expect everybody to keep giving it,
forgiving it?

There's a war in my, I can't take the strain
Insane in the brain runnin like a freight train
I feel no remorse, I feel no pain
I'm the punisher kid an I'm taking you out
Say you prayers son, it's the final death bout
If I gotta take you out it don't mean a thing
I'll be the last man standing

Body baggin fools try to scheme for the skriller
I kill like old patrone tequila

Bring my enemies to his knees and I'm blasting

My blood starts pumping, racin through my veins
I'm a cold blooded killah stalking my prey
The taste of blood gets me high
I'll fight to the finish, I'll fight till I die

I rise and stand against anybody or anything
In the end I will be, I'll be the last man standing

"Biohazard Switchback lyrics
Welcome to the rat race, people killing themselves
To get ahead of the pack, backstab and attack.
Out for self, the money, the power, the fame,
Competition and greed in a world without shame.
I stumble and fall along the path I've chosen,
I face my fears, I won't be broken.
Corrosion has a way of fucking with your sanity,
I do what I gotta to preserve my humanity.

Switchback - taking life as each day comes
Switchback - facing fears, I never run,
Switchback - never quit until I'm done
I'm the underdong and I will overcome.

Confrontation can break you down to your very fast compound.
Beat you down, drag you round, break you
Refuse to bend, never ever let it take you
Over the edge where you can never break through.
Overcome, switchback, stand strong alone
The good, the bad, the truth, the unknown
Locked up at war with the demons within
I fight to live, I live to win.

The harder that I battle with lifes deceit,
The stronger I stand on my own two feet.
If I allow the world to assimilate my mind,
Will my freedom be forever denied?
Will I no longer be free in my mind?",Biohazard
"Someday I hope to rise above material chains which hold me down
To turn my anger into love and keep my feet planted on the ground.
To undo stigmas societies branded, misconceptions about being a man.
To be grateful, take nothing for granted, to live the truth as best I can.

I seek the truth whatever that may be,
I seek the answers to questions, please God help me.

To look at people and see no color, vision clear of prejudice or spite,
To treat people just like my brother, for this I pray with all my might.
To learn to let go of all my fears and learn to embrace all of my tears,
To search for faith and humility, to walk the path which sets me free.

Salvation, from society, damnation, have mercy on me.

So many lies I told, so many lives I've sold.
So far away from who I am I never understand.
So many things I regret, so many things that I let
Take me away from myself, too late to take it back.

So many dreams I had, so many lives I've lived
So many friends I said goodbye forever
So many times I wish, so many times I dream,
Do it again, I swear I'd never.

In my quest to uncover the truth the deepest wounds get left behind
As I seek serenity from the war, from the war inside my mind.",Biohazard
"Where to run to, where to hide, much to full to swalllow my pride
But I'm still haunted by something inside as if another part of me
has died.

Paralyzed, I close my eyes, the pain inside surrounds me.
Petrified, life fades away, at the end of my rope I'm waiting.

Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone, empty inside, out of control.
My heart a void, my empty soul, until it's filled I'll never be whole.
How did things ever get so bad, sinking empty, full of despair
I find myself alone and scared, in a world where nobody cares.

Help, arm in arm, hand over fist and carry you where necessary

I tried so hard, so sad to watch you drown.

You turned and pointed fingers at the truest friend you ever had,
And I prayed to God you'd find relief from the things that you made your
life sad.
We were down forever, together forever all as one,
But when the time came to step up and do it right, I saw you turn and run
I tried so hard, to help you hold it down
You never helped yourself, so sad to watch you drown.
I tried so hard, to help you save your life
You never helped yourself, shut the door and say good-bye.

I will not go quietly, I will never bow down to them.

I close my eyes, I can see more clearly,
You criticize the things I hold dearly
You victimize because you fear me

How can you feel it unless it happens to you?
Watching someone suffer there's nothing you can do.
Sit and wait with love and hate, emotions, they destroy,

How can I worship a God who takes life away
And leaves nothing but pain that never goes away.
I lie in bed each night, struggle to fall asleep,
Memories in my head, i pray my soul to keep.

Can't you see it's gone forever, out of sight and out of mind.

Twisted, broken, I sit and watch as you decline

It leads to your demise, I see it in your eyes.

Since our opinions contradict our statements,
We show our prejudiced affliliations.

Decline of civilization

In all our lies and our self pity
It's time to stop our apathy.

You say you're a victim in pain
But you always prey on someone to blame.
You want to end the suffering for the hungry and the poor
When they ask for help you slam the door.
You want housing for the public good
But not in your own neighbourhood.
Industrial pollution makes you sick,
But you ain't got time for politics.

You want the world to be a better place

"Treated unfairly, you resent everybody that has so much
Of the things in life that were taken away from you.
So wrapped up in your misery, you never feel the love that surrounds you,
So wrapped up in your misery, you never notice that life passed you by.

You've waited all your life for the pain to go away
Lock yourself inside a world that makes you hate.

Left it all alone, ignored by the one you need attention from
For the things in life you never achieved on your own.
He can't be bothered to care for you, to hold and respect and be there for you,
He can't be a real father to you, some day he'll regret all time that went by.

You've waited all your life for the pain to go away
And I've always hated to see you hurt inside.
So much I try to help but you push me away,
Lock yourself inside a world that makes you hate
Locked inside a world of hate.

Beaten down for as long as you remember
Your life was analyzed, criticized and dismembered
Your hopes and dreams were discouraged and severed
the pain you've endured, the suffering you've weathered
You find it so hard to pull yourself together
To face the world to your fears you surrender,
You dream of a day you'll overcome and sever,
The cycle of abuse and the pain you've carried forever.

You're not alone, there's so many others that care for you,
So many things in our lives you helped us all get through
It means so much to me that you're here to share in my life
And calm my tears, it means so much to me that you're alive,
As you hold my child and wipe the tears from your eyes.",Biohazard

War is no solution to the conflicts that we face
The end of our evolution, revolution, resist the hand of fate.

Armageddon, the end draws near, reality becomes our biggest fear
The future once seemed so free and clear, darkest hour, life disappears.
Punishment for greed and lust, mass genocide, holocaust
Foretold predictions of the end upon us, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

We wage a ware which can't be won,
Apocalyptic suicide, what have we done?

Fire, one day a great fire shall come
Rain, a cleansing rain will wash away the scum
War, blood thirsty savages we've become
Revelation, judgment night and now we're done.

I pride myself on my sill to survive, i will fight to stay alive
We've got the power, destroy or create,
Terminate ourselves with our love for hate.
Every night I kneel down and pray,
There's nothing I can do to make it go away.
We march for peace and scream for change
But the dogs of war will forever remain.",Biohazard

pushing bodies in wheel barrels, bitches sterile follow on crutches of
rusted arrows try to breath through esophagus stuffed with sparrows,

Fear of death, will my life go on?

My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins

Bound in fear for what I've got

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar, as I kneel down and I
Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of
the truth, whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right
off the roof, 'cause I did things normal and just like all my friends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a

I've been told a thousand times to give respect when due
Why do you find it so hard to believe I've got none for you
It's my heart and my mind that I'll always follow, I will not break
Nor will my balls, although that I've seen that you've tried
before
Why are people fake?

Maybe you're older, wiser on your own right, it's your mistake
I'm gonna do my own thing regardless, my choice to make
I am real, in touch with my feelings, and I know my place
You have shown, on the other hand, both sides of your face

I see the world in a different light
Things not always black and white
Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey

I would never try and tell you what was right from wrong
Maybe that's why you feel that I don't belong
Always put me down for things I've said and done
Can't you see it's a war that can't be won

A war that can't be won

Living in your world seems so clear and concise
Shutting out reality makes everything so nice

Are we mentally sick
Feeling inside that drive us like pride
Or emotional scars from our friends that have died
And make us build walls so incredible high

Some vent it as rage, it's the fashion these days
In a twisted society, we drown in anxiety
Has push come to shove, have we killed the dove
Are we caught in a fit, what makes us tick
Has man gone insane, are we feeling the strain
We must dig and must pick at what makes us tick

Pissin' down your leg, you're a victim of carjack
Feel the cold steel as I pull the hammer back

Society pushed him down and out
soul provider what's it all about
Religion can we do without
Social pressure we're too strung out

Kid of fourteen, high aspiration held
to get ahead and run shit with his powerful will
Told by his role model you're old enough to kill

If ya want to survive be prepared to shoot
Stay hard like me and you're bound to do well

Face the facts, stone cold sober

On and on the media rolls
Drive by shootings, homicide
Nobody cares about the mother who cried
A family's grief stepped on by ratings
Understand why I keep hating

It makes no sense for us to be pawns
In the chess game that the media plays

If the streets are where you run
There you die, why? Find yourself a way out

Black and white and red all over

Ruling out the positive and any hope for peace
This will only kill morale, paper sales increase
This shit has got to cease

Black and white and red all over

Believe half of what you read and half what you see
Put two and two together and you'll have reality
Can't you see my reality?

So what'cha gonna do you'll be dead in a minute
Thinking slow will get you nowhere fast

Ain't no time to change your mind when your head begins to sag

"Yo this is biohazard from brooklyn new york dropping some respect for almighty
Black Sabbath 1994 Motha Fuckas

Have you ever thought about your soul, can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay your grave
Is God just within your head or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a namethat you read in a book when you were at school?

When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope---Do you think he's a fool?
Well I have the truth. Yes I have seen the light and I've changed my ways.
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scaredat the end of our days.

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believed in God above
They should realize before they criticise
That God is the only way to love.

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer whemn death is near
And say they might as well worship the sun.

I think it is true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad that the opinion you had was the only one voiced.
Will you be so sure when your day is near say you won't believe?
You had a chance but you turned it down now you can't retrieve.

Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realize that he is the one,
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate.
Or will you still jeer at all you hear?
Yes---I think it's too late.

Help me escape these walls I climb

I'm drowning in my own shit, gasping
Gagging on the vomit, asphyxiated, grasping
For a grip on the soap with the rope
So I can get clean and begin to cope

Scrub me 'til I'm raw, an open sore oozing
Unless I'm clean I might start losing
My mind and my life would have a fucked-up ending
Thank God if you ever see cleansing

Maggot infested soul of mine
Has painted me in a corner confined
My vision is blurred no reason or rhyme
Help me escape these walls I climb

Sewn my eyes shut, can't you see I'm smothered?
Deaf, dumb and blind, the dirt has covered
The windows which let the light shine through
Cleansing of the soul, for I am you

The last time I slept I dreamt
My friend and I we got so high
On top of mountains, deep in the sky
Way up high where the white goes by

The air is thin and hard to breathe
But with a friend near, by your side 
you can conquer the world or wander around all starry-eyed
I laid there and dreamt, along for a ride

I took in the journey, my friend beside
It all seemed so real, it all seemed surreal
my friend and I were one deep inside

These dreams come and go and are never the same
I await new journeys asleep I remain
When I hold my eyes shut tight I dream
When I dream at night through my dreams I scream

Why do people fucking go and have to change?
What pushed my friend to tap the vein?
Asleep at night I visit my friend
Asleep at night I miss my friend

The dirt's so thick it won't come clean
All around a haze like a smoke screen
I can't see you but you see me
But I might be gone before you count to three

The waters are totally polluted
The armies inside my head have feuded
One side has smothered the other
The disease it spreads and begins to cover

Maggot infested soul of mine
Has painted me in a corner confined
My vision is blurred no reason or rhyme
Help me escape these walls I climb

Sewn my eyes shut, can't you see I'm smothered?

The windows which let the light shine through
Cleansing of the soul, for I am you",Biohazard

Was it for how fast we lived and died?
Or because we never got our piece of the pie?

Parents with good intentions never mention

Incest and murder, raping the rat race

But my reflex is to try to break out
Nature gives fight or flight syndrome
But my feet stay on the ground, that's how I've grown
Bred to resist the gravity of anything that's fucking with me
Survivalist instincts through my veins are pounding
Transfused at birth by my urban surroundings

Gravity won't allow me to fly
It pulls me down, the pain, I won't cry
Resistance and drive fueled by hunger
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

I just can't let shit get to me
Got to reflect back on what pop taught me
To be your own man no matter what
To never back down, and follow your gut
Instinct, something he said that I'd know
Something that I'd carry wherever I go
He told me someday I'd have to fight to be free
And resist the weight of gravity

Gravity won't allow me to fly
It pulls me down, the pain, I won't cry
Resistance and drive fueled by hunger
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

Calloused hands wipe away tears
Of the pain of a man broken by years
A silent shot that nobody hears
A smoking gun of our own fears
My father worked all his life and for what?
Day in, day out, caught in a rut
The pain of apathy, razor-sharp cutting
But I'll make sure he doesn't die for nothing

The sun's gone down now, behind the dark clouds looming
Birds stop singing, silence so soothing
Dark clouds open up, I hold my rain-soaked head

I've picked the scab, a trying way, a painful means to amend
Rid myself from the anguish, torment that I must end
I've lived this way for years but now I gotta move on

Burning high and higher, pressure starts to climb
Turning passion into sweat, Jekyll into Hyde

As my love gets set aside
Magnified by hate inside

Face down upon the ground
Looking down at her, you start to frown
Thinking to yourself, ""Am I insane to do the things I do to her in vain?""

Woman beater with your hands wrapped around her neck
Deranged, demented, a psycho-social wreck
Your self-denial, hatred, got to keep it in check
You rape for love and you kill for respect

I find myself all alone
The pain will wash away
Unless she is taught, she has been shown
It's got to be my way

And now she is gone
The blood is on my hands
No remorse, what have I done?
And act of God or man?

In this world of bigotry and pain
The violence spreads and terror reigns
The opinions in our minds replace our souls

Twisted in a sense, 'cause my button has been pressed
How many ways have you shown me that you hate me
And then you wonder why what have you done to me lately
I am an animal
The human animal
A human animal

Time to take action, release frustration
Everyone has limits, only so much you can take
Antagonizing pressure is the icing on the cake
Physical abuse, induced or subliminal

Flashes of red my vision of distortion
Like a virus, it spreads, giving each his portion
Contagious psychopath, the vibe is in synch

Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of

of the people are out there smoking crack, getting doped up,
shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a

Have you ever thought about your soul, can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay your grave
Is God just within your head or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a namethat you read in a book when you were at school?

When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope---Do you think he's a fool?
Well I have the truth. Yes I have seen the light and I've changed my ways.

If they knew you believed in God above
They should realize before they criticise
That God is the only way to love.

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer whemn death is near
And say they might as well worship the sun.

I think it is true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad that the opinion you had was the only one voiced.
Will you be so sure when your day is near say you won't believe?
You had a chance but you turned it down now you can't retrieve.

You kept your head down and your powder dry
Memories of families
It's God i've known
Take me home
Now you live asking God why
He didn't take you when your brothers all died
Explosions shake the dreams in your head at night in bed
Don't wake him up or you'll end up dead
Try to understand his pain
He still sees blood stains that remain
In his heart and mind, try to numb the pain
People think they understand
Sat watching TV back on quiet land
They spit on you now we'll spit back for you
Our hearts, our voice, gift of our hands
What can they do for you and those who served
And died, we pay respect to the families
Who still cry
Your kids are now full grown
With the love and pride you should have known
Back when your country brought you home
Still now you fight the tears and face your fears each day
But the horrors of fact won't go away
For 2300 MIA's or POW's to this day
We remember and pray for you",Biohazard
"Walkin' five blocks every day to earn my keep
It ain't easy when you're walkin' on these streets
Runnin' on a tightrope it's a real thin line
Thinkin' that you might die this time
Some things will never change, a street education
So close yet so far, just a block from the station
Standin' on the corner, I might get taken out
Five blocks to the subway, just five blocks away
Five blocks to the subway, I can do that any day
There's a local wise guy he owns the whole damn block
It's easy doin' business when you're payin' off the cops
Makin' money pushin' drugs wouldn't stop if he could
Killin' kids in his own damn neighborhood
Watch out for muggers and the pickpockets beware
You get to play these games when you pay transit fare
Trials and tribulations, a journey made each day
This is my reality,the hardest game to play
Standin' on the platform and I'm waiting for the train
Good thing I'm underground, now it's startin' to rain
Always stand alone, hold the wall up with my back
Or else you might get pushed on to the tracks",Biohazard
"Each day I have another choice too
To try and make things right
I awake from the nightmare
Another day closer to the grave
With a personal affair
And my fright is in moderation
It just might be the death of me
I am aware

I'm not worried about tomorrow
Don't give a f*ck about yesterday
To get through this day of sorrow
I must face what comes my way

Each day I need some kind of release
To pull the trigger on my soul and
Breathe through the bullet hole
I need some peace
Before I am deceased
I want to see my world in its
Negative state, become a positive place
By unleashing all the hate within

I'm not worried about tomorrow
Don't give a f*ck about yesterday
To get through this day of sorrow
I must face what comes my way
Each day
Every fucking day
Day by day

I'm not worried about tomorrow
Don't give a f*ck about yesterday
To get through this day of sorrow
I must face what comes my way

")Inner city strugglin', motherfuckin' rat race
Condemned pressure cooker, that explodes in your face
Another neighborhood gets destroyed by the drug deal
Staking a claim on an estate that is real
Pay the mob's price for your own protection
Half a wise guy makes the wrong connections
Flooding our streets with your want to be bullshit
Who whacks who, don't matter who gets hit
The space between the death of our friends is so close
This month it was neglect, our boy died of an overdose
Last month a gunshot, a typical story
That's just the way it goes in a failed territory
No hope, just dope, and your chances are slim
To grow up and get out 'cause you're already in
The vacuum of the street so powerful
Sucking you in it drains your mind by the hour fool
Still smoking dippers our friends are all dusted
Slave to a bottle of juice, fucking disgusted
Can't you see the neighborhood's black hole
And the odds are that we'll never grow old
Young guns scam running on a get ahead quick tip
With your pretty ass crimes, you're on a blind road trip
Day to day death, wish we all carry inside
Welcome to your suicide
So you call yourself a part of the avenue crew
Living here doesn't offer much else to do
But get into beef and take each other's back
Kid of eighteen, broke his skull with a bat
Always changing with the trends like a fucking chameleon
Live for yourself 'cause you're one in a million
A rebel 'cause you weren't born into wealth
But the only thing holding you down is yourself
On the road we get phone calls breaking our hearts
When they find someone we love in the trunk of a car
Nothing you can do. Just another sad story
Wake up, break out
An epitaph from your own self doubt",Biohazard
"Lack of trust, all alone
Lookin' down at the bottom of a hole
I've no trust, bare my soul
Are we alone or do we have friends
Or are we just searchin' for a means to an end
What up, peace out, my boys and all that
But as soon as we leave they talk behind our backs
Low selfimage of the way things are
Either way we lose and we can never go far
'Cause always we'll wonder as to just what's the deal
It just depends on what you feel is real
Perception is everything inside our brains
With much bigger problems, no time for games
Of people acting down but it's just a facade
Can't say it to my face, isn't that odd
Just what exactly does trust mean
Is it about being down with the scene
Or is it about following your own true heart
And being true to your friends to the end from the start
Just what is wealth it's just how you view it
It's not having to wonder whether or not you might lose it
It can't be about material gain
If you're drowning alone neck deep in pain
To trust and lay your soul on the line
May not be the nature of most humankind
Lookin' over your shoulder is no way to go
So stick with true friends and do without the doubt",Biohazard
"You don't care about
Self doubt coming out from inside out
Knock you down, across town all around the underground
Shooting and disputing you're always persecuting
With your attitude and fucked up views tattooed, rude and crude
Denying, glorifying your way of life while crucifying
Close your eyes for the ride while you glorify your false pride
In any case you're blue in the face 'cause you lost your place in the human race
That pushed you to do what you do so f*ck you and your point of view

I used to doubt myself because I lived without
What I needed inside
My pride, comes from inside
Nothing to hide enough tears cried
My pride won't be denied
Moan and groan and chew the bone about the zone you call your own
Grow your own backbone hold your own and stand alone
Why pretend and be content with all the hate you hold innate
Pull your weight, it ain't too late to recreate your inner state
Discontent with time ill spent time has come and time has went
Now you vent while you torment why resent ? misrepresent
The scene between the lean and mean serene, extreme, the American dream

Live alive revive and thrive on life deprived as I survive
I'm fuckin' pissed off I used to be so angry
I'd disagree with anything that went against inside me
But things have changed I've rearranged in exchange for all the pain

I kept inside and tried to hide denied and lied, but kept my pride
By my side in good supply all the while, hostile
And senile, I never smiled at anyone but now I'm done
A battle won for number one so look and see and you'll agree
I live life free, I now know me I am a man who knows he can
I know I can, I take my stand",Biohazard
"The monster of hate overcomes rational thought
Fast fuse burning the lessons I've been taught
It's just too late to remember who I am
The things that I believe in and the way that I stand
About peace, harmony, respect for fellow man
All that shit just got thrown against the fan
In my violent rage, they say that I am a criminal
There ain't no labels within the human animal
In this world of bigotry and pain
The violence spreads and terror reigns
The opinions in our minds replace our souls
As the human animal takes control
The path of self-destruction has brought me to this point
As modern day society cracks arthritic joints
No mercy is shown, it's hitting all my weak spots
I never had a gun, but now I want to hear gun shots
I sleep not for fear, I get no rest
Twisted in a sense, 'cause my button has been pressed
How many ways have you shown me that you hate me
And then you wonder why what have you done to me lately
I am an animal
The human animal
A human animal
Tension building, I'm being pushed too far
I need a release, take the lid of this jar
My voice seems useless in this situation
Time to take action, release frustration
Everyone has limits, only so much you can take
Antagonizing pressure is the icing on the cake
Physical abuse, induced or subliminal
Open the door, unleash the human animal
Flashes of red my vision of distortion
Like a virus, it spreads, giving each his portion
Contagious psychopath, the vibe is in synch
Movin' like a pack, we're back to basic instincts
Wild at heart, now we show our true colors
In the path of desperation, we forget about our brothers
Who would die for us, now, we die for no man
Deranged from the instance, violence came too hard
Instinctual behavior in the given situation
Leaves us with no call for rationalization",Biohazard
"Sometimes I feel it's a waste of time
To listen to your shouting a wordless pantomime
Can't you see it falls on deaf ears
Filling me up with your point of view
Your opinions are your own, I got mine too
What I think don't mean nothing to you
When the shit hits the fan
And you're forced by the man
Who holds the key to our promised land
Don't misunderstand what's in the man's hand
'Cause it's all been laid out in the New World Plan
Makin' me feel like a laboratory rat
Without a mind of its own - diseased and fat
I can't let my life go out like that
'Cause I'm an extra skeptic, a true eclectic
I find it hard to trust all the people we've elected
Take a look around, do you feel protected
Like garbage in a dump our lives have been rejected
A blind man leading the not so blind
Creating false truth to fill our minds
To listen to yourself would be a crime
It all comes back to you some time
Like it or not, they got a number on me
I will not break for your demands
Rabid, defensive, in the corner I stand
Caught in a trap, the bait was free
Like it or not, they got a number on me
I can't trust anyone, they're all out to get me
Gonna run until I can't run from the laws that ruin me
Faster and harder so God help me flee
From the lies that we're free and the powers that be
That push the rich forward between you and me
But agree to agree with no guarantee
Of something to live for I'll die if need be
I stand up for all as I fight to be free",Biohazard

But now you're in the dirt, can of underground wormfood
Stupid motherfucker, you thought you would last
Well took the wrong path, now your name is in the past

Another fuckin' lowlife connected to the first
A crooked cop on the take, nothing could be worse
Twenty one gun salute, the widow lays the wreath
The whole police department covered up he was a thief
Yeah the city's finest, caught in deepest shit
Never tought the day would come, bang, a fuckin' hit
You call yourself the finest in the city, huh!
For scum like you,I have no fucking pity

Pushing and scumming, disribute all your poison
You call yourself a man, well you're nothing but a boy

A real man works hard, starves to climb the ropes
Not killing for money, on the corner selling dope
Money isn't everything, I guess it was to you
Did you control your own life or greed controlled you
For the lives that you destroyed, so morally depraved
For the people you left grieving, I spit on your grave

I can't deny reality as life gets smothered

If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
Cause he who paints the big picture runs the whole scene

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous? Am I better off dead?

Punishment, for all my sins

A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind

Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate? On the corner rolling dice
Punishment, but I've done nothing wrong
In my eyes, who really pays the price

My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done
Sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got
Though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar, as I kneel down and I
Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of
the truth, whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right
off the roof, 'cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
but now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact that the majority
of the people are out there smoking crack, getting doped up,
shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a
question we all ask and must answer before long, 'cause no one
is safe in this world, what's the deal, the sentence is death and to
what court do I appeal?

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

"I make now a stand for belief that I'm steadfast
In hating all of the bullshit you give me doubt my future, present and past
Who are you to infringe your values upon me, I've learned the hard way
Stepping on my toes, you've put my back to the wall, my back to the wall

I've been told a thousand times to give respect when due
Why do you find it so hard to believe I've got none for you
It's my heart and my mind that I'll always follow, I will not break
Nor will my balls, although that I've seen that you've tried
before
Why are people fake?

Maybe you're older, wiser on your own right, it's your mistake
I'm gonna do my own thing regardless, my choice to make
I am real, in touch with my feelings, and I know my place
You have shown, on the other hand, both sides of your face

I see the world in a different light
Things not always black and white
Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey

I would never try and tell you what was right from wrong
Maybe that's why you feel that I don't belong
Always put me down for things I've said and done
Can't you see it's a war that can't be won

A war that can't be won

Living in your world seems so clear and concise
Shutting out reality makes everything so nice
Paint a pretty picture black and white everyday
See my tattered canvass bleeding shades of grey

Not the fucking industry
You fucking tell us what is cool
You see we came from different schools

You got no crowd but you got a big push
Kissing asses till your pride turns into mush
You might change your style for the record company
Fingers down your throat, you heave your integrity

You're weak, give it up, throw the towel and the flag in
And get your pussy ass of the motherfuckin' bandwagon
Never for a minute were you real in the first place
So far up someone's ass you got shit on your face

Step the f*ck back, 'cause it's probably true
The message in the music is the reason that we're in this
Music is for you and me, not the fucking industry

"Fascism, the epitome of ignorance
Listen up, I'll give you a for instance
People go hating for the color of skin
Won't they learn they'll never win
Play not the hands of the media vultures
We must learn to unite our cultures
Violence constantly tears us apart
Show the world that we've got heart

Blood is spilled on black and white
Different colors, why do we fight
Face the facts, stone cold sober
Black and white and red all over

Thousands die and kill each other
Someone rapes and stabs their mother
I think it'ssick to count the death toll
On and on the media rolls
Drive by shootings, homicide
Nobody cares about the mother who cried
A family's grief stepped on by ratings
Understand why I keep hating

It makes no sense for us to be pawns
In the chess game that the media plays

If the streets are where you run
There you die, why? Find yourself a way out

Black and white and red all over

Ruling out the positive and any hope for peace
This will only kill morale, paper sales increase
This shit has got to cease

Black and white and red all over

Believe half of what you read and half what you see
Put two and two together and you'll have reality
Can't you see my reality?

[Chorus]

Turn on the TV and what do I see
Killing, murder and blasphemy
Rape, arsan, robberies
People die of incurable disease
Crashes, bashes, people on crack

If war sell papers why don't peace",Biohazard
"A man with a promise smashes down my door
He sees a future with me, he's gonna give me more

Just sign the dotted line, and I'll do so the rest""

But I've always been on my own, he doesn't know who I am
And now I'm starting to see just what you are to me
A parasitic leech of my life

[Pre-chorus:]

You feed off the art that I bleed
You're a man with a promise but you ain't shit to me

A man broke his promise and he wants reparations
He sold me up the river, cause me grief and frustration
I gave him all my trust and got stabbed in the back
A lucky motherfucker that he hasn't yet been whacked
You ain't no fucking artist, spend your life exploiting others
Try all you want, you can't break me or my brothers
A business man vulture,no honor, no class
Take your money and your lawyers and shove 'em up your ass

Don't ever think that you ripped me apart
And walked away with a price
Cause you can not penetrate my cold heart
ANd fill it with your disease

I wonder now how I lived before
Deaf, dumb, dead and blind
I moved my life forward and I'm never goin' back
And I've left you far behind
There's a lot of things that I've now realized
From the way that you treated me
It's bullshit and it's hatred you epitomized
You were blessed to have been with me

Disease is flowing through my veins
I'd rather die right now than live in pain

Looking around at the past and the present
Things are so much better now
Your misery wanted my company

I'd die a happy man

"Growing up I've seen a lot of shit in my time
I've seen hunger, hunger, pleasure, pain, violence and crime
I have learned from the mistakes of my friends that have died
And from those who have gone down in life that just never tried
Life is just too short I realize that now
I'm gonna get my shit together and try to make it some how
Cause one thing that I have learned is that you only live once
So now I'll take life by the balls and squeeze until they crunch

Knowledge of the streets, a valuable tool
Type of education you can't get in school
Many hard times, losing friends, getting burned
Nobody to teach me, I just learned
A man like clay molded by his surroundings
He starts to take shape of the beating and the pounding
Assembly line that I've been through
A hard motherfucker with a bad attitude
Maybe its just the times we live in
Maybe its just urban discipline

The ways of urban life are not as they seem
Standing up and fighting is what living here means
In order to survive you've got to earn your respect
The only lessons that you learn are from things that you regret

Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island and Queens
Standing up and fighting is what living here means
In order to survive you've got to earn your respect
The only lessons that you learn are from things that you regret",Biohazard
"Not even for a second when he wake up did he ask
If today was gonna be his last

Terminated by a sharp knife
Killing, spilling the liquid blood
As his boyz found him lying face down in the mud
You might say this song is in poor taste
But I must discuss the waste

[Chorus I:]

Of lives of friends that I have lost
Who pays the price, who pays the cost
Can't cry, just anger till the end
It burns inside to lose a friend

Walking thin lines, anything to cop a dime
Labelled habitual, a loser three times
Just fucking' around, knuckles bloody to the bone
Whatever, the future's unknown
Unless you believe in predestination of fate
The letter read termination
It was fucked up I couldn't make out his face
Through the blod, what a fucking waste

[Chorus I]

[Chorus II:]

My friend was there until the end (my friend)
Can never be replaced
The pain that I taste (It's over)
What a fucking waste

[Chorus I]

Cold blooded murder, suicide, another body laid to rest
Untimely demise, homicide, my faith is put to the test
Is there a god, sometimes I just can't believe
My friend who is dead was shot and then robbed
Something quite hard to conceive
People dying everyday there's got to be a better way
The losses blow my mind away, the stain of blood will always stay
Like the memory of a friend who stood with me until the end
The losses blow my mind away, the stain of blood will always stay

[Chorus I]

[Lead]

It's not for me that I grieve, but for the families left berieved
I question whether life is fair, I wonder if I even care
We think we know what life is worth until they lower us beneath
the earth

"Early man walked away as modern man took control

Should I hope to be vindicated

Always alone, society's abortion
Self mutilation, the daily partion
Resentful past breeds hopeful future
With tears of blood, I remove the sutures

Dying inside, emotions they hide
Irreparable damage from the tears that I've cried
I climb from the sewer, the years that I have
spent
Self mutilation or my environment

[Chorus: Repeat x2]
Tears of blood, tears of blood
I cry, I cry
Tears of blood, tears of blood
I die

Deny myself for fear of being
Is it over now, has my heart stopped beating
Lying here just self defeating
My mind is empty, it won't stop bleeding
Twisted anger screams my brain
Over the edge, I hang in pain
Mouth locked shut my mind won't swallow
With tears of blood alone I wallow

No one to blame except myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Maybe its just a matter of pride
Too sweet to end with suicide

Peel the scab, pour salt in the wound
Torturing myself, I'm forever doomed
Looking east and west each and every moon
A peaceful rest comes somebody soon

No one to blame expect myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Is death life and do we live in hell?

[Chorus: Repeat x3]",Biohazard
"Look into the yes of a madman
You can see it in his face, he's a weak and sad man
Staring straight ahead, his eyes set like stone
With a nine millimeter cocked at your dome
No way out, it's too late 'cause you're already in it
So what'cha gonna do you'll be dead in a minute
Thinking slow will get you nowhere fast
A young life terminated with one short blast
You live like that, you die like this
That's how it is
Livin' with regret is no way to live
That's how it is
You're dead too soon if the bullet don't miss
That's how it is kid
How it is
That's what you get for
Living like this
With a bullet in your head, you're dead, you can't miss
Ain't no time for regret when you're body is in a bag
Ain't no time to change your mind when your head begins to sag
Should've known better, ain't working for you now
Maybe if you'd know better you'd be here somehow
So change your ways before you ways change you
With a hole in your head that you can see through
You're looking up and you're looking down
Shot's are rippin' out from all around
You're crying out for help but it can't be found
The voice of regret is the only sound
You play the game and you pay the price
For hustlin' in the gutter with the motherfuckin' street lice
You're runnin' and gunnin' and whatever else goes
And you're goin' with your crew whichever way the wind blows
""Cause you got their back and they got yours
And you live for yourself and you make your own laws
But sooner or later what goes around comes around
You wind up dead and buried in hard, cold ground",Biohazard
"I question not me, it only happens to others
I can't deny reality as lite gets smothered

If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
'Cause he who paints the big picture
Runs the whole scene

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous, am I better off dead?

Punishment for all my sins

A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind

Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate on the corner rolling dice
Punishment but I've done nothing wrong in my eyes
Who really pays the fucking price

My lament for the human race
Guilty punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done, sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar
As I kneel down and I confess to the Father
That I'm suffering a burning question of the truth
Whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right off the roof
'Cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
But now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact
That the majority of the people are out there smoking crack
Getting doped up, shooting that shit into their veins
The question must be asked if we have any brains left

Or right or wrong in this song
A question we all ask and must answer before long
'Cause no one is safe in this world, what's the deal
The sentence is death and to what court do I appeal?

Punishment for all my sins, I repent
Punishment

Part of your heart
Will separate
It will

The gift of your life
All what was concealed
No skin-deep a dive
Your childhood revealed

You jump in heat
Plunge to your start
Don't underestimate
You're own point of view
Don't part your art
Or hesitate
Your will

The gift of your life
All what was concealed
No skin-deep a dive
Your childhood revealed

You peel all the layers of forever
You start the beginning of the end
Breathing is bridging the gap
Between black and light

And now you feel alive!
And now you learn to dive you know!
Breathing is bridging the gap
Between black and light",The+Gathering

Through this storm 
What fortune love may bring 
Back to my arms again 
The love of a former golden age. 
 
I am disabled by fears concerning which course to take. 
For, now that wheels are turning, 
I find my faith deserting me... 
 
This night is filledwith cries of 
Dispossessed children in search of Paradise. 
A sign of unresolve that, 
Envisioned, drives the pinwheel on-and-on. 
 
I am disabled by fears concerning which course to take. 
When memory bears witness to 
The innocence, consumed in dying rage!

There can be no other means to the end, 
Or keys to my heart...

The cold wind speaks for our lost
Whispering words, weaving worlds
Her time has come, alas

A man with opened eyes
One stopped out of a dream
With a view held within his mind
The tears for his bride redeem

Watching this world falling apart
Like the dreams in a shallow sleep
Countless are the nights they shared
The mourning in his tears

But morning still has broken
A light in his world of dawn
All beauty turned to rot
His flowers, all are gone

Close the eyes of eternal love
Buries his face in his hands
Her face looks so alive
In the morning sun

But morning still has broken
A light in his world of dawn
All beauty turned to rot
His flowers, all are gone

Illusions for one to see

Alone...

By holding you down on your knees

To find your way back inside

"Hush, hush, little baby, don't you cry
Hush, hush, little baby, don't you cry
Daddy works in a rock and roll band
He's a drummer man
Plays all night in a crummy dive
Down on Lincoln Street
Living in a rat trap, hassle and
A-hustle with the welfare plan
Lord, it's tough when 
You're living with a dream
Of a drummer man

Hush, hush, little baby, don't you cry
Don't you know, little baby, bye and bye
Daddy's really going to 
Make it big like Ringo done
Be a Hollywood cat and live up
In the canyon where the sun shines
If we can just hold on till
We find that once in a lifetime plan
Oh, Lord, it hurts to be living with a dream
Of a drummer man
He's a drummer man, 
That's what he is
And I love him so
And I clean his jeans
And I dry his tears
When the breaks don't come, 
And it ain't no fun
He's my man 
And he's a real good drummer
It's a bummer when you've got to play
The nickel and the dime
Kind of job that don't pay enough 
To buy a can of beans
Chicken bone's clean

Hush, hush, little baby, don't you cry
Hush, hush, little baby, don't you cry
Daddy works in a rock and roll band
He's a drummer man
He beats out time, drinks a lot of bad
Wine down on Lincoln Street
One day Daddy's going to be a star
But in the meantime
Oh, Lord, it's tough to be living with a dream
Of a drummer man
Child it's tough but your Daddy is a dream
Of a drummer man",Nancy+Sinatra

And I've heard you laugh when in my heart I knew you wanted to cry and when the truth it might have hurt me I've heard you tell a lie and that is why I love you like I do. 

God knows I love you. God knows I do

Now I carry sweet and gentle your first baby child. I live within the bright anticipation of your smile. Even in the bad times it seems like you never gave in. Standin' behind me and fightin' for me blindly and cryin' when I get a whippin'. You cried when my puppy died just because I cried. And I've heard you laugh when in my heart I knew you wanted to cry.

Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone.

We went so high we couldn't stop
We climbed the ladder leading us nowhere
Two of us together
Building castles in the air

We spun so fast we couldn't tell
The gold ring from the carousel
How could we know the ride would turn out bad
Everything we wanted
Was everything we had

I miss the hungry years
The once upon a time
The lovely long ago
We didn't have a dime
Those days of me and you
We lost along the way

How could I be so blind
Not to see the door
Closing on the world
I now hunger for
Looking through my tears
I miss the hungry years

We shared our daydreams one by one
Making plans was so much fun
We set our goals and reached the highest star
The things that we were after
Were much better from afar

Here we stand just me and you
With everything and nothing, too
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay
Honey take me home

Lost out in the street
Loving the chaos
With my heart down at my feet

Taking every step like it's my very last
Looking round the corners
Searching through the glass
For a glimpse of you
Eyes of shining blue
All these memories of you come to haunt me
They come to haunt me

Taste the stinging rain
Falling on my tongue
Hanging on your words
Cherish every one
Can't bring you back no matter what I say
Driving in my car just to drive away
Hear the tires spin
Round and round again
All these memories still come to haunt me
They come to haunt me

The city sleepin' cross the river
I'm up alone burning down the spark
Well I wonder where you are tonight
And how far you drifted out there, out there in the dark

Wind at my window
Rattling the door
Pounding on my heart
Like it's never done before
Still I wonder if it could be these memories
No matter how I try they never let me be
Always find a way
Calling out your name
All these memories of you stay and haunt me

Mmh they still haunt me
Oh they come and haunt me

In a week - or maybe two - they'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years and quickly pass
And all the stars, there never were, are parkin' cars and pumpin' gas

You can really breathe in San Jose
They got alot of space
There'll be a place where I can stay

I'm going back to back to some kind of peace of mind in San Jose

It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart, you're never alone

And there you are, without a friend, you pack the car and you ride away

And any barmaid can be a star maid

Go out and try your luck, you might be Donald Duck

"Saturday in the park
I think it was the 4th of July
Saturday in the park
I think it was the 4th of July

People dancing, people laughing
A man selling ice-cream singing Italian songs
[Foreign Content]
Can you dig it? Yes I can
And I've been waiting such a long time for Saturday

Another day in the park
I think it was the 4th of July
Another day in the park
I think it was the 4th of July

People talking, really smiling
A man playing guitar and singing for us all
Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it? Yes I can
And I've been waiting such a long time for today

Slow motion riders fly the colors of the day
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way
Listen children all is not lost, all is not lost, oh no, no

Funny days in the park
Every day's the 4th of July
Funny days in the park
Every day's the 4th of July

People reaching, people touching
A real celebration waiting for us all
If we want it, really want it
Can you dig it? Yes I can
And I've been waiting such a long time for the day

"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
Then I was thinking to myself this could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say

[Chorus]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
(Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year
(Any time of year)
You can find it here""

Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the captain, ""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say

[Chorus]

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said, ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device""
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man, ""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like but you can never leave""",Nancy+Sinatra
"Amor estoy solo agui en la playa

Es el sol quien que me acompana

why me quema, why me quema, why me quemana




Cuando calienta el sol aqui en la playa
Siento tu cuerpo vibrar cerca de mi



Es tu palpitar, es tu cara, es tu pelo



Son tus besos, me estremezco (Oh oh oh)
Cuando calienta el sol


Cuando calienta el sol aqui en la playa



Siento tu cuerpo vibrar cerca de mi
Es tu palpitar, tu recuerdo, mi locura

Mi delirio, me estremezco (Oh oh oh)

Cuando calienta el sol

You make me feel like spring has sprung
Every time I see you grin
Such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I want to run and play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon

You and I
We're just like a couple of tots
Running around the meadow
Pickin' up all those forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung

I'm gonna to feel the way I do, today

Nights in white satin

Never reaching the end

Letters I've written

Never meaning to send



Beauty I'd always missed

With these eyes before


Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore



Cause I love you

Yes I love you


Oh how I love you


Gazin at people


Some hand in hand
They can't understand
Just what I'm goin through





Cause I love you
Yes I love you

Oh how I love you



Some try to tell me

Thoughts they cannot defend


Just what you want to be

You will be in the end


Cause I love you
Yes I love you


Oh how I love you

The weather there is nice and warm!
The climates of a Southern brand,
But here's what I don't understand:
They got a gal there, a pretty gal there,
Who's colder than an Arctic storm,
Got a heart just like a stone,
Even ice men leave her alone!

They call her Hard Hearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town;
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher,
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
Is her delight, they say,
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan,
There was Hannah pouring water on a drownding man!
She's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah, GA!

They call her Hard Hearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town;
Talk of your cold, refrigeratin' mamas,
Brother, she's a polar bear's pajamas!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
Is her delight, they say,
An evening spent with Hannah sittin' on your knees,
Is like travelin' through Alaska in your BVDs.
She's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah, GA!

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah
She's got the right name, The vamp of Savannah

And start pouring water on a drownin' man

"Tell you babe. im not the lovin' kind
So you'd better get it right off of your mind
I'll give you money, I don't care
I'll take you with me, anywhere
Oh, tell you babe, I'm not the lovin' kind

Tell you babe I'm not the lovin' kind
Get you somebody else,
And you'll do just fine
Cast your tears into the sea
Don't waste your tears on me
I tell you babe, I'm not the lovin' kind

I tell you baby I'm not the lovin' kind
So you'd better move on down the line
I told you do
I've never lie
Loves a train I never ride
Oh tell you babe, I'm not the lovin' kind

I told you so, I've never lied
Loves a train I'll never ride
Oh tell you babe, I'm not the lovin' kind",Nancy+Sinatra
"The sun brought me 
 The moon caught me 
 The wind fought me 
 The rain got me 
 The road sent me 
 For years bent me 
 The stars overwhelmed me 
 Time and again 
 But now I can't see the stars 
 The star is a thing I can't see 
 And now I don't feel the same 
 To feel is a thing I can't be 
 Earth crushed me 
 Fame brushed me 
 The streets hushed me 
 As life touched me 
 Time placed me 
 Events dazed me 
 Love saved me 
 Now and again 
 But now there can be no love 
 Love is a thing I can't be 
 And there can be no trust 
 Trust is a thing I can't see 
 But now there can be no love 
 Love is a thing that can't be 
 Now I can't be so strong 
 Strong is a thing I can't be 
 Time and again 
 Time and again 
 The sun brought me",Nancy+Sinatra
"Well it's cryin' time again you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now, they say that absent makes the heart grow founder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger, no
If I'd live to be a hundred years old

Oh, it's cryin' time again you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now you say you found someone that you love better
Well that's the way it happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes out tomorrow
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door

Oh, it's cryin' time again you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Ooh yeah",Nancy+Sinatra
"My baby cried,all night long
My baby cried all night long

He saw me dancing with a boy named Joe
A hug and then a kiss and with the lights down low

And my baby cried all night long
My baby cried all night long
My baby cried all night long

He saw me messin with a boy named Lu
And baby can't do what Lu can do

And my baby cried all night long

Last night I cried all night long
Last night I cried all night long

I saw my baby out on the town
Doing all the things I've done
And made brought me down
And then I cried all night long
Yeah,last night I cried all night long.

(spoken)And tomorrow this story is that you shouldn't become a messing,when you shouldn't be messin.
Were you end up crying,all night long?
And that's where I am look : Crying all night long...

"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long 
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say 
But they get wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar

I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway 
On Broadway 
On Broadway",Nancy+Sinatra
"I have tried to make you love me 
I've done everything your way
And I'm crying for the words you'll never say
You think love is an illusion
That must end in sad conclusion
If that's what you feel that's just how it will be
And I can't grow peaches on a cherry tree

When I see the peaches blossom
I'll regret I said goodbye
I remember cherry kisses and I'll cry
But I can't go on pretending
That our love is never ending
For you can't be loved unless you want to be
And I can't grow peaches on a cherry tree

Someday I will find a new love
But for you there can be no love
For you can't be loved unless you want to be
And I can't grow peaches on a cherry tree

"There's a little bird that somebody sent
Down to the earth to live on the wind
Going on the wind and he sleeps on the wind
This little bird that somebody sent

He's light and fragile and feathered sky blue
So thin and graceful the sun shines through
This little bird who lives on the wind
This little bird that somebody sent

He flies so high up in the sky
Way out of reach of human eye
And the only time that he touches the ground
Is when that little bird
Is when that little bird
Is when that little bird dies

"These shades can hide the teardrops crying
But not the way I feel inside
These shades can only do their part oh yeah
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
These shades can hide my red red eyes
But not the hurt left by your lies
These shades can only do their part oh yeah
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
Dark shades I'll keep on wearin' as long as I'm still caryin'
For you and I still love you so oh why did you go now
These shades can hide my eyes away
But not the pain I feel each day
These shades can only do their part oh yeah
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
These shades can't hide a broken heart ",Nancy+Sinatra
"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",Nancy+Sinatra
"Cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

Somebody help me please 
I'm as helpless as I can be
And I don't know what my life is comin' to
Now they say that I shot a man 
Well I never shot I ran
And that was my first mistake I'm telling you

Ah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

I got a man in Wichita and a man in Saginaw
And they both ain't heard from me in some time
I hate to disappoint them both but some feller under oath
Said I did it and they believed his story not mine

Ah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

There's snow all over the ground 
And there ain't one robin around, that I'd trust to carry a message to a friend
I guess I'll just stay here till spring 
I sure wish I knew what spring
They'd let me out so I can start again

Ah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail, yeah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail",Nancy+Sinatra
"I've been where the eagle flies
Rode his wings 'cross autumn skies
Kissed the sun, touched the moon
But he left me much too soon
His lady bird
He left his lady bird

Lady bird come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird I'll treat you good 
Aw, lady bird I wish you would
You lady bird
Pretty lady bird

Lightning flashed across the sky
The night he taught me how to fly
The sun came up and then I found
Too soon he let his lady down
His lady bird
I'm his lady bird

Lady bird come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird I'll treat you good 
Aw, lady bird I wish you would
You lady bird
Pretty lady bird

Winter lives in my heart
In the times we're apart
Summer sings a song or two
When he says ""I love you true""
My lady bird
Yeah, I'm his lady bird

Lady bird come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird I'll treat you good
Aw, lady bird I wish you would

You're a lady bird (Yes, I'm a lady bird)
You're too much you little bird",Nancy+Sinatra
"Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wond'ring in the night
What were the chances we'd be sharing love
Before the night was through.

Something in your eyes was so inviting,
Something in you smile was so exciting,
Something in my heart,
Told me I must have you.

Strangers in the night, two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello.
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away,
A warm embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together.
Lovers at first sight, in love forever.
It turned out so right,
For strangers in the night.",Nancy+Sinatra
