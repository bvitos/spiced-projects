The Legend Of The Last Of The Outlaw Truckers AKA The Ballad Of Sheriff Shorty

I was a shift shake shoe shake child around
I used to live down town down in trucker town
I was the baddest, baddest, baddest around
But it was fifteen years since I heard a sound
They said look it, look it, come on down
'Cause when the law start shaking, a shaking 'em down
They're called the last of the outlaw truckers around

'Cause I'm me, see
Jacked up on java and nicotine
Whoa-oh please believe me
I know what I mean

By the time we get to Texas he was lying 'em down
With the bag 'o bodies all covered the ground
I said now look it, look it, look what I found

Short, come out and you know
I left the armload of M16's back home
I served 68 missions in da nang alone
Now I'm a one more mission, that's you and that's right

'Cause I'm me, see
Jacked up on Meth and Dexedrine
Whoa-oh, please believe me
I know what I mean
And I'm clean
Oh, I'm getting right pious now
But if you'd seen what I've seen
Oh you know what I mean

And I said look around, looking out and below
You know its hard to chase shorty up in new mexico

And then I gotta get him down to new orleans
I'll go to eight states, in eight states straight
Shorty you hesitates on an Ace of Hate

We even got you started down in baton rouge
Well Shorty started shakin' while makin' his stand
So stacks went off to get the gun from his hands
He said Shorty got a minute? You're getting the job
But then he pulled another pistol and said with a smile
"Son you'd better be fast... I'll put you on the ground"
And that's about the time that sheriff shot shorty down

'Cause I'm mean, see
Jacked up on meth-amphetamines
And oh-oh, please believe me
I know what I mean
And I'm clean
And oh, getting all pious now
If you've seen what I've seen
Oh you know what I mean
