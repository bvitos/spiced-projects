I close your eyes with my mouth
Now you don't see anything
But you feel my breath all over
I can feel you too
Although i don't really know you
I don't really care
Cry with me, make my day
Tomorrow all will be gone
All the sweetness and all the fun
No, i don't want to know
Although i don't really know you
I don't really care
Now that you're gone i don't know
How to really feel inside
Baring the hope to see you again
I guess i never will
Now that i do really know you
Yes, i really care!
